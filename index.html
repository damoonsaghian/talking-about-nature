<h2>1, talking about nature</h2><div>talking is in fact nothing but separating and grouping, they are the foundation of all concepts</div><div>this is especially evident in mathematics (a way of talking, in which the relations between concepts are clear,</div><div>	and thus the foundation of any concept is determined)</div><div>	the concept of a set (a group of parts) is the foundation of all mathematical concepts</div><div>the subtle point here is that, separating and grouping are circular concepts,</div><div>	each defined using the other (yin and yang)</div><div><p></p></div><div>nature (everything) can't be a set</div><div>in other words, there is no set of everything, because at least it can't contain itself</div><div>even if we define sets, in a way that they could be members of themselves,</div><div>	again a set of everything would not be possible (it's called Russell's paradox)</div><div>this is why:</div><div>suppose that we have a set named set1</div><div>another set named set2 contains those sets in set1 that are not members of themselves</div><div>it turns out that set2 cannot be in set1, here is the proof:</div><div>	suppose that set2 is in set1, set2 is either a member of itself or it is not</div><div>	if set2 is a member of itself,</div><div>		then by its definition set2 must not be a member of set2, a contradiction</div><div>	if set2 is not a member of itself,</div><div>    	since it is a member of set1 which is not a member of itself, set2 must be a member of set2,</div><div>    	again a contradiction</div><div>	this shows that no set contains everything because at least it can't contain set2</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's the talking that must be contained in nature (eg in the form of a brain), not the other way around</div><div>nature, universe, reality, everything, god, being, or whatever we call it,</div><div>	is not a group of parts, though it can be described as a group of parts approximately</div><div>ironically only the existence of (approximate) groups and parts in our brains,</div><div>	allows us to talk about nature in general</div><div>so talking about nature, with approximate concepts, is possible, and indeed very useful,</div><div>	it's called physics</div><div><p></p></div><div>quantum theory and general relativity (discussed in the following chapters) are</div><div>	the best theories of physics we have at hand,</div><div>	two different ways to talk about two different areas of nature</div><div>it's only at extreme areas namely Planck scales, that they meet each other,</div><div>	and this meeting turns out to be disastrous, and at the same time, a useful guide to a unified theory</div><div>	(as discussed in the chapter on Planck scales)</div><div>we will see that quantum theory and general relativity, when combined, imply that:</div><div>	at Planck scales nature can't be described with parts and groups,</div><div>	because at those scales the assumption that nature is a group of parts,</div><div>	is not a good approximation any more</div><div><p></p></div><div>but even without mentioning quantum theory and general relativity,</div><div>	we can predict the main aspects of the unified theory</div><div>since nature is not a concept, all concepts used in the unified theory must be unobservable</div><div>if something is observable, it means that it is a part of nature,</div><div>	and it is observed through interaction with other parts</div><div><p></p></div><div>the following paragraph is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller <a href='http://www.motionmountain.net/'>http://www.motionmountain.net/</a></div><div>indeed there must be one and only one unobservable concept</div><div>	if it was observable, the theory would not be final,</div><div>	if there were more unobservable concepts, the theory would be fiction, not science …</div><div>in any unified theory, all the concepts that appear must be only approximately parts of the whole</div><div>thus we need an entity, describing nature which is not a set but which can be approximated by one</div><div>for example, the approximation should yield a set of space points and a set of particles,</div><div>	but also, whenever we look at any part of nature, without any approximation,</div><div>	we should not be able to distinguish it from the whole world</div><div>the simplest model would be a single entity which is extended and fluctuating,</div><div>	reaches spatial infinity, allows approximate localization,</div><div>	and thus allows approximate definition of parts and points</div><div>in more vivid imagery, nature could be described by some deformable folded and tangled entity,</div><div>	a giant knotted amoeba</div><div>	an amoeba slides between the fingers whenever one tries to grab a part of it</div><div>	a perfect amoeba flows around any knife trying to cut it,</div><div>		the only way to hold it would be to grab it in its entirety</div><div>	however, for someone himself made of amoeba strands, this is impossible</div><div>	he can only grab it approximately, by catching part of it,</div><div>		and approximately blocking it, for example using a small hole,</div><div>		so that the escape takes a long time</div><div>strand theory proposed by Christoph Schiller is an attempt for a unified theory of physics</div><div>	(it's discussed in the last chapter)</div><div><p></p></div><div>still, no matter how we describe nature, we are here as pretty evolved parts of it</div><div>	in fact we are so evolved that we can alter the path of evolution itself</div><div>	the problem is that we are not still evolved enough to use this ability properly</div><div>we are going to create more suffering, and ultimately the destruction of all which has been achieved,</div><div>	if we continue what we are doing now (excluding a few developed countries)</div><div>though it is possible that the evolution goes one step further,</div><div>	leading to humans that can add to the beauty and richness of nature</div><div>	see "a new earth" by Eckhart Tolle</div>
<h2>2, spacetime, particles and fields</h2><div>spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product</div><div><p></p></div><div>vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts whose precise definitions can easily be found online</div><div>a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is totally ordered, and has a complete metric</div><div>	this means that the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers</div><div><p></p></div><div>in a vector space with Minkowski inner product, all normal vectors (for which we have: v^2 = ±1),</div><div>	are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:</div><div>	b_i b_j = g_ij</div><div>	where:</div><div>	g_ij = {</div><div>		0 if i!=j</div><div>		-1 if i=j=0</div><div>		1 otherwise</div><div>	}</div><div>vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:</div><div>	v.i = v b_i</div><div>thus the inner product can be written as:</div><div>	v1 v2 = g_ij v1_i v2_j</div><div>by convention repeated indexes in a multiplication means summing over those indexes</div><div>and for convenience we use this notation:</div><div>	v1_i v2_i' = g_ij v1_i v2_j</div><div><p></p></div><div>transformations which leave the distance (ie |v2 - v1|) invariant,</div><div>	are called symmetry transformations of spacetime</div><div>they can be written as ("d_i" is an arbitrary displacement):</div><div>	v'_i = L_ij v_j + d_i</div><div>	where: L_ik L_il = g_kl</div><div><p></p></div><div>symmetry transformations of spacetime, form a group called spacetime symmetry group,</div><div>	which is a ten'parameter non'Abelian Lie group</div><div>so the representations of spacetime symmetry group can be deduced,</div><div>	using the representations of its corresponding Lie algebra,</div><div>	plus the projective representations (since it's not a simply connected group)</div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor</a></div><div><p></p></div><div><b>why 3 dimensions for space?</b></div><div>this simple but usually overlooked question can actually be a guide to a unified theory,</div><div>	by implying extended entities</div><div>3 is the only number of dimensions in which knots are possible</div><div>Zeeman proved that (considering topological isotopes, or even piecewise linear isotopes),</div><div>	spheres can make knots only when the co'dimension is 2</div><div>	(co'dimension is the difference between the dimension of the sphere and the container space)</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is another phenomena which i think is related to this: exotic smooth structures exist only on R^4</div><div>ie when "n" is not 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to R^n is diffeomorphic to R^n</div><div>i think the origin of this phenomena is the failure of the Whitney trick,</div><div>	which i think is because of co'dimension 2, between 2'disks used in Whitney trick, and the 4 dimensional space</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>particles</b></div><div>point particles in a relativistic theory (in which instantaneous action at a distance isn't allowed),</div><div>	lead to infinite self'field (thus external finite fields can't accelerate the particle)</div><div>"self'force on a classical point charge, Robert M.

<h2>3, quantum theory</h2><div>observations like the double'slit experiment, show that:</div><div>	universe is made of discrete but extended entities called quanta</div><div>quanta must be entirely and instantaneously created or destroyed in discrete units (like particles),</div><div>	even though each unit is generally infinitely extended (like fields)</div><div><p></p></div><div>existance of minimum action implies that particles don't exist, and free fields change in quantized amounts</div><div><p></p></div><div>"Art Hobson, there are no particles, there are only fields"</div><div>	<a

href='https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~babis/Teaching/QFT1/qft1.pdf'>https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~babis/Teaching/QFT1/qft1.pdf</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>fields can be considered as the probability amplitude for interaction of quanta</div><div>	this makes the measurement (which relies on interaction), a probabilistic procedure</div><div>the fact that everything, even measurement tools, have field behaviors, implies that:</div><div>	measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty</div><div>uncertainty principle is a property of fields:</div><div>	Δx Δk &gt;= 1/2</div><div>	Δt Δf &gt;= 1/2</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>strong and weak interactions</b></div><div>strong and weak interactions (unlike electromagnetism) have very short ranges,</div><div>	thus in practice we always work with them in small scales,</div><div>	and with relatively small number of quanta</div><div><p></p></div><div>strong interaction is described by a SU(3) gauge symmetry</div><div>	(3rd order special unitary group, the set of all 3 by 3 unitary matrices with unit determinant)</div><div>it implies 8 gauge quanta which even interact with each other,</div><div>	leading to confinement, and thus the short range of strong interaction</div><div><p></p></div><div>weak interaction is described by a broken SU(2) gauge symmetry</div><div>the symmetry must be broken, otherwise weak interaction would have long ranges</div><div>to explain this symmetry breaking, we need another quanta called Higgs boson</div><div><p></p></div><div>the apparent violation of mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries in weak interactions,</div><div>	is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles (not an asymmetry of spacetime itself)</div><div>in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles,</div><div>	seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries,</div><div>	because we are not considering the internal structure of particles</div><div>in other words, CPT symmetry is not violated</div><div>the important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that,</div><div>	quantons have some kind of internal structure</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>hints to extended entities</b></div><div>this section is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller</div><div><p></p></div><div>any particle that is smaller than its own Compton wavelength must be elementary</div><div>	(the Compton wavelength of a particle is equal to the wavelength of a photon,</div><div>		whose energy is the same as the mass of that particle)</div><div>if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it</div><div>	this lighter particle would have a larger Compton wavelength than the composite particle</div><div>	this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle must be larger than</div><div>		the Compton wavelength of its components</div><div>however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact,</div><div>	as extended constituents have no localized mass</div><div><p></p></div><div>in the strand theory, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands</div><div>in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter, strands are</div><div>if particles could really be elementary, it would be impossible to understand their properties</div><div>in the strand model, particles are not really elementary,</div><div>	but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed</div><div>	particles are tangles of unobservable strands</div><div>in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle,</div><div>	but gets rid of its limitations</div><div>if one wants to think radically, the strand theory can be seen as,</div><div>	eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle</div><div><p></p></div><div>a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century</div><div>any belt provides an example:</div><div>	it is a famous exercise to show that such a model is indeed invariant under 4π rotation,</div><div>	but not under 2π rotation</div><div>two such particles get entangled when exchanged, but get untangled when exchanged twice</div><div>particles can have spin 1/2, provided that they have tails going to the border of space</div><div>	if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work</div><div>spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension</div><div><p></p></div><div>explaining black hole entropy seems to demand extended entities too</div>
<h2>4, Planck scales</h2><div>at extremely small scales of spacetime, called Planck scales,</div><div>	the mom'energy of quantum particles can be so high that black holes appear</div><div>therefore at Planck scales, nature is not observable, spacetime is indistinguishable from particles and fields,</div><div>	they must be described by the same (unobservable) thing</div><div>the rest of this section is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller</div><div><p></p></div><div>general relativity and quantum theory contradict each other</div><div>	in practice however, this happens only at Planck scales</div><div>whenever we combine general relativity and quantum theory,</div><div>	the universe teaches us that it is not a set of parts</div><div>for this reason, any sentence or expression containing the term "universe",</div><div>	is probably meaningless, whenever complete precision is required</div><div><p></p></div><div>combining quantum theory and general relativity leads to several important results on the description of nature:</div><div>, there is no conceivable way to prove that points exist,</div><div>	as the smallest measurable distance in nature is the Planck length</div><div>, vacuum and particles mix at Planck scales,</div><div>	as there is no conceivable way to distinguish whether a Planck sized region,</div><div>	is part of a particle or of empty space</div><div>, matter, radiation and vacuum cannot be distinguished at Planck scales,</div><div>	they are made of common constituents</div><div>, particles, vacuum and continuous space do not exist at Planck scales,</div><div>	they disappear in a yet unclear Planck scale mixture</div><div><p></p></div><div>elements and sets must be abandoned</div><div>this radical conclusion is deduced from only two statements:</div><div>, the necessity of using quantum theory whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Compton wavelength</div><div>, and of using general relativity whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Schwarzschild radius</div><div>together, they mean that no precise description of nature can contain elements and sets</div><div>the difficulties in complying with this result,</div><div>	explain why the unification of the two theories has not so far been successful</div><div>not only does unification require that we stop using space, time, and mass, for the description of nature,</div><div>	it also requires that all distinctions, of any kind, should be only approximate</div><div>but all physicists have been educated on the basis of exactly the opposite creed</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need a description of nature that allows us to state that:</div><div>	at Planck energy nothing can be distinguished from anything else</div><div>there is only one solution:</div><div>	everything (or at least, what we call "everything") must be made of the same single constituent</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is an intriguing relation between Planck scales and cosmological scales,</div><div>	they seem to pose the same challenges to their description</div><div>there is a tight relation between large and small scales in nature</div><div>there seems to be little difference (if any at all) between the universe and nothing</div>
