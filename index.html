<h2>1, talking about nature</h2><div>talking is essentially nothing but separating and grouping;</div><div>  separating and grouping are the foundation of all concepts;</div><div>this is especially evident in mathematics</div><div>  (a way of talking, in which the relations between concepts are clear,</div><div>    and thus the foundation of any concept is determined);</div><div>  the concept of a set (a group of parts) is the foundation of all mathematical concepts;</div><div>the subtle point here is that, separating and grouping are circular concepts,</div><div>  each defined using the other (yin and yang);</div><div><p></p></div><div>nature (everything) can't be a set;</div><div>in other words, there is no set of everything, because at least it can't contain itself;</div><div>even if we define sets, in a way that they could be members of themselves,</div><div>  again a set of everything would not be possible (it's called Russell's paradox);</div><div>this is why:</div><div>suppose that we have a set named set1;</div><div>another set named set2 contains those sets in set1 that are not members of themselves;</div><div>it turns out that set2 cannot be in set1, here is the proof:</div><div>  suppose that set2 is in set1, set2 is either a member of itself or it is not;</div><div>  if set2 is a member of itself,</div><div>    then by its definition set2 must not be a member of set2, a contradiction;</div><div>  if set2 is not a member of itself,</div><div>    since it is a member of set1 which is not a member of itself,</div><div>    set2 must be a member of set2, again a contradiction;</div><div>  this shows that no set contains everything because at least it can't contain set2;</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's the talking that must be contained in nature (eg in the form of a brain),</div><div>  not the other way around;</div><div>nature, universe, reality, everything, god, being, or whatever we call it,</div><div>  is not a group of parts, though it can be described as a group of parts approximately;</div><div>ironically only the existence of (approximate) groups and parts in our brains,</div><div>  allows us to talk about nature in general;</div><div>so talking about nature, with approximate concepts, is possible, and indeed very useful;</div><div>  it's called physics;</div><div><p></p></div><div>quantum theory and general relativity (discussed in the following chapters)</div><div>  are the best theories of physics we have at hand;</div><div>  two different ways to talk about two different areas of nature;</div><div>it's only at extreme areas like Planck scales that they meet each other,</div><div>  and this meeting turns out to be disastrous,</div><div>  and at the same time, a useful guide to a final unified theory</div><div>    (as discussed in the chapter on Planck scales);</div><div>we will see that quantum theory and general relativity, when combined, imply that</div><div>  at Planck scales nature can't be described with parts and groups,</div><div>  because at those scales the assumption that nature is a group of parts,</div><div>    is not a good approximation any more;</div><div><p></p></div><div>but even without mentioning quantum theory and general relativity,</div><div>  we can predict the main aspects of the final theory;</div><div>since nature is not a concept, all concepts used in the final theory must be unobservable;</div><div>if something is observable, it means that it is a part of nature,</div><div>  and it is observed through interaction with other parts;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the following sentences from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller, describe it very well:</div><div>indeed there must be one and only one unobservable concept;</div><div>  if it was observable, the theory would not be final,</div><div>  if there were more unobservable concepts, the theory would be fiction, not science …</div><div>in any unified theory, all the concepts that appear must be only approximately parts of the whole;</div><div>thus we need an entity, describing nature which is not a set but which can be approximated by one;</div><div>for example, the approximation should yield a set of space points and a set of particles;</div><div>  but also, whenever we look at any part of nature, without any approximation,</div><div>  we should not be able to distinguish it from the whole world;</div><div>the simplest model would be a single entity which is extended and fluctuating,</div><div>  reaches spatial infinity, allows approximate localization,</div><div>  and thus allows approximate definition of parts and points;</div><div>in more vivid imagery, nature could be described by</div><div>  some deformable folded and tangled entity, a giant knotted amoeba;</div><div>  an amoeba slides between the fingers whenever one tries to grab a part of it;</div><div>  a perfect amoeba flows around any knife trying to cut it,</div><div>    the only way to hold it would be to grab it in its entirety;</div><div>  however, for someone himself made of amoeba strands, this is impossible;</div><div>  he can only grab it approximately, by catching part of it,</div><div>    and approximately blocking it, for example using a small hole,</div><div>    so that the escape takes a long time;</div><div>strand theory proposed by Christoph Schiller is an attempt for</div><div>  the final unified theory of physics (it's discussed in the final chapter);</div><div><p></p></div><div>still, no matter how we describe nature, we are here as pretty evolved parts of it;</div><div>  in fact we are so evolved that we can alter the path of evolution itself;</div><div>  the problem is that we are not still evolved enough to use this ability properly;</div><div>we are going to create more suffering,</div><div>  and ultimately the destruction of all which has been achieved,</div><div>  if we continue what we are doing now; (excluding a few developed countries)</div><div>though it is possible that the evolution goes one step further,</div><div>  leading to humans that can add to the beauty and richness of nature;</div><div>  see "a new earth" by Eckhart Tolle;</div>
<h2>2, spacetime, particles and fields</h2><div>spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product;</div><div><p></p></div><div>vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts</div><div>  whose precise definitions can easily be found online;</div><div>a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is</div><div>  totally ordered, and has a complete metric;</div><div>  this means that the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers;</div><div><p></p></div><div>in a vector space with Minkowski inner product,</div><div>  all normal vectors (for which we have: v v = 1 or -1)</div><div>  are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:</div><div>    basis.i basis.j = g.i.j</div><div>    g.i.j = if i=j=1 then -1 elseif i=j then 1 else 0</div><div>vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:</div><div>  v.i = v basis.i</div><div>thus the inner product can be written as:</div><div>  v1 v2 = g.i.j v1.i v2.j</div><div>by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices;</div><div><p></p></div><div>transformations which leave the distance</div><div>  (ie (v2 - v1)^2\2 where "\" is rooting operation)</div><div>  invariant, are called symmetry transformations of spacetime;</div><div>they can be written as:</div><div>  v'.i = L.i.j v.j + v0.i</div><div>  g.i.j L.i.k L.j.l = g.k.l</div><div><p></p></div><div>symmetry transformations of spacetime, form a group called symmetry group of spacetime,</div><div>  which is a ten_parameter non'Abelian Lie group;</div><div>so the representations of Lorentz group can be studied using the corresponding Lie group;</div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_a_Lie_group'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_a_Lie_group</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor</a></div><div><p></p></div><div><b>particles</b></div><div>point particles in a relativistic theory</div><div>  (in which instantaneous action at a distance isn't allowed),</div><div>  lead to infinite self'field (thus external finite fields can't accelerate the particle);</div><div>"self'force on a classical point charge, Robert M.

<h2>3, quantum theory</h2><div>observations like the double'slit experiment, show that</div><div>  universe is made of discrete but extended entities called quanta;</div><div>quanta must be entirely and instantaneously created or destroyed in discrete units (like particles),</div><div>  even though each unit is generally infinitely extended (like fields);</div><div><p></p></div><div>"Art Hobson, there are no particles, there are only fields"</div><div>  <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.4616.pdf'>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.4616.pdf</a></div><div>"Babis Anastasiou, quantum field theory"</div><div>  <a href='https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~babis/Teaching/QFT1/qft1.pdf'>https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~babis/Teaching/QFT1/qft1.pdf</a></div><div>"Hitoshi Yamamoto, quantum field theory"</div><div>  <a href='http://epx.phys.tohoku.ac.jp/~yhitoshi/particleweb/particle.html'>http://epx.phys.tohoku.ac.jp/~yhitoshi/particleweb/particle.html</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>fields can be considered as the probability amplitude for interaction of quanta;</div><div>  this makes the measurement (which relies on interaction), a probabilistic procedure;</div><div>the fact that everything, even measurement tools, have field behaviors, implies that</div><div>  measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty;</div><div>uncertainty principle is a property of fields:</div><div>  Δx Δk &gt;= 1/2</div><div>  Δt Δf &gt;= 1/2</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>strong and weak interactions</b></div><div>strong and weak interactions (unlike electromagnetism) have very short ranges;</div><div>  thus in practice we always work with them in small scales,</div><div>  and with relatively small number of quanta;</div><div><p></p></div><div>strong interaction is described by a SU(3) gauge symmetry</div><div>  (3rd order special unitary group, the set of all 3 by 3 unitary matrices with unit determinant);</div><div>it implies 8 gauge quanta which even interact with each other,</div><div>  leading to confinement, and thus the short range of strong interaction;</div><div><p></p></div><div>weak interaction is described by a broken SU(2) gauge symmetry;</div><div>the symmetry must be broken, otherwise weak interaction would have long ranges;</div><div>to explain this symmetry breaking, we need another quanta called Higgs boson;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the apparent violation of mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries in weak interactions,</div><div>  is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles</div><div>  (not an asymmetry of spacetime itself);</div><div>in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles,</div><div>  seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries,</div><div>  because we are not considering the internal structure of particles;</div><div>  in other words, CPT symmetry is not violated;</div><div>an important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that</div><div>  quantons have some kind of internal structure;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>hints to extended entities</b></div><div>this section (except the last two paragraphs) is quoted from</div><div>  "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller (<a href='http://www.motionmountain.net/'>http://www.motionmountain.net/</a>);</div><div><p></p></div><div>any particle that is smaller than its own Compton wavelength must be elementary;</div><div>  (the Compton wavelength of a particle is equal to the wavelength of a photon</div><div>    whose energy is the same as the mass of that particle)</div><div>if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it;</div><div>  this lighter particle would have a larger Compton wavelength than the composite particle;</div><div>  this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle</div><div>    must be larger than the Compton wavelength of its components;</div><div>however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact;</div><div>  as extended constituents have no localized mass;</div><div><p></p></div><div>in the strand theory, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands;</div><div>in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter, strands are;</div><div>if particles could really be elementary, it would be impossible to understand their properties;</div><div>in the strand model, particles are not really elementary,</div><div>  but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed;</div><div>  particles are tangles of unobservable strands;</div><div>in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle,</div><div>  but gets rid of its limitations;</div><div>if one wants to think radically, the strand theory can be seen as,</div><div>  eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle;</div><div><p></p></div><div>a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century;</div><div>any belt provides an example; it is a famous exercise to show that such a model</div><div>  is indeed invariant under 4π rotation, but not under 2π rotation;</div><div>two such particles get entangled when exchanged, but get untangled when exchanged twice;</div><div>particles can have spin 1/2, provided that they have tails going to the border of space;</div><div>  if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work;</div><div>spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension;</div><div><p></p></div><div>explaining black hole entropy seems to demand extended entities too;</div><div><p></p></div><div>extended entities can even explain the 3 dimensionality of space too;</div><div>  space is 3 dimensional because it's the only number of dimensions in which knots are possible;</div><div>Zeeman proved that (considering topological isotopes, or even piecewise linear isotopes)</div><div>  spheres can make knots only when the co'dimension is 2;</div><div>  (co'dimension is the difference between the dimension of the sphere and the container space)</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is another phenomena which i think is related to this:</div><div>  exotic smooth structures exist only on R^4;</div><div>  ie when "n" is not 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to R^n is diffeomorphic to R^n;</div><div>i think the origin of this phenomena is the failure of the Whitney trick,</div><div>  which i think is because of co'dimension 2,</div><div>  between 2'disks used in the Whitney trick, and the 4 dimensional space;</div>
<h2>4, Planck scales</h2><div>at extremely small scales of spacetime, called Planck scales,</div><div>  the mom'energy of quantum particles can be so high that black holes appear;</div><div>therefore at Planck scales, nature is not observable;</div><div>  spacetime is indistinguishable from particles and fields;</div><div>  they must be described by the same (unobservable) thing;</div><div>the rest of this section is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller;</div><div><p></p></div><div>general relativity and quantum theory contradict each other;</div><div>  in practice however, this happens only at Planck scales;</div><div>whenever we combine general relativity and quantum theory,</div><div>  the universe teaches us that it is not a set of parts;</div><div>for this reason, any sentence or expression containing the term "universe",</div><div>  is probably meaningless, whenever complete precision is required;</div><div><p></p></div><div>combining quantum theory and general relativity</div><div>  leads us to several important results on the description of nature:</div><div>, there is no conceivable way to prove that points exist,</div><div>  as the smallest measurable distance in nature is the Planck length;</div><div>, vacuum and particles mix at Planck scales,</div><div>  as there is no conceivable way to distinguish whether</div><div>  a Planck sized region is part of a particle or of empty space;</div><div>, matter, radiation and vacuum cannot be distinguished at Planck scales,</div><div>  they are made of common constituents;</div><div>, particles, vacuum and continuous space do not exist at Planck scales,</div><div>  they disappear in a yet unclear Planck scale mixture;</div><div><p></p></div><div>elements and sets must be abandoned;</div><div>this radical conclusion is deduced from only two statements:</div><div>1, the necessity of using quantum theory whenever</div><div>  the dimensions are of the order of the Compton wavelength;</div><div>2, and of using general relativity whenever</div><div>  the dimensions are of the order of the Schwarzschild radius;</div><div>together, they mean that no precise description of nature can contain elements and sets;</div><div>the difficulties in complying with this result, explain why</div><div>  the unification of the two theories has not so far been successful;</div><div>not only does unification require that</div><div>  we stop using space, time and mass for the description of nature,</div><div>  it also requires that all distinctions, of any kind, should be only approximate;</div><div>but all physicists have been educated on the basis of exactly the opposite creed;</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need a description of nature that allows us to state that</div><div>  at Planck energy nothing can be distinguished from anything else;</div><div>there is only one solution, everything (or at least, what we call "everything" in everyday life)</div><div>  must be made of the same single constituent;</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is an intriguing relation between Planck scales and cosmological scales,</div><div>they seem to pose the same challenges to their description;</div><div>there is a tight relation between large and small scales in nature;</div><div>there seems to be little difference (if any at all) between the universe and nothing;</div>
