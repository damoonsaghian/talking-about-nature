<h2>1, talking about nature</h2><div>talking is essentially nothing but separating and grouping;</div><div>  separating and grouping are the foundation of all concepts;</div><div>this is especially evident in mathematics</div><div>  (a way of talking, in which the relation between concepts is clear,</div><div>    and thus the foundation of any concept is determined);</div><div>  the concept of a set (a group of parts) is the foundation of all mathematical concepts;</div><div>the subtle point here is that, separating and grouping are circular concepts,</div><div>  each defined using the other (yin and yang);</div><div><p></p></div><div>nature (everything) can't be a set;</div><div>  in other words, there is no set of everything,</div><div>    because at least it can't contain itself;</div><div>even if we define sets, in a way that they could be members of themselves,</div><div>  again a set of everything would not be possible (Russell's paradox);</div><div>to see why, suppose that we have a set named set1;</div><div>  another set named set2 contains those sets in set1 that are not members of themselves;</div><div>  it turns out that set2 cannot be in set1, here is the proof:</div><div>    suppose that set2 is in set1, set2 is either a member of itself or it is not;</div><div>    if set2 is a member of itself,</div><div>      then by its definition set2 must not be a member of set2, a contradiction;</div><div>    if set2 is not a member of itself,</div><div>      since it is a member of set1 which is not a member of itself,</div><div>      set2 must be a member of set2, again a contradiction;</div><div>    this shows that no set contains everything because at least it can't contain set2;</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's the talking that must be contained in nature (eg in the form of a brain)</div><div>  not the other way around;</div><div>nature, universe, reality, everything, god, being, or whatever we call it,</div><div>  is not a group of parts, though it can be described using them approximately;</div><div>  only the existence of approximate groups and parts in our brains,</div><div>    allows us to talk about nature in general;</div><div>so talking about nature, with approximate concepts, is possible, and indeed very useful;</div><div>  it's called physics;</div><div><p></p></div><div>quantum theory and general relativity (discussed in the following chapters)</div><div>  are the best theories of physics we have at hand;</div><div>  two different ways to talk about two different areas of nature;</div><div>it's only at extreme areas like Planck scales that they meet each other</div><div>  and this meeting turns out to be disastrous,</div><div>  and at the same time, a useful guide to a final unified theory</div><div>    (as discussed in the chapter on Planck scales);</div><div>we will see that quantum theory and general relativity, when combined, imply that</div><div>  at Planck scales nature can't be described with parts and groups,</div><div>  because at those scales the assumption that nature is a group of parts</div><div>    is not a good approximation any more;</div><div><p></p></div><div>but even without mentioning quantum theory and general relativity,</div><div>  we can predict the main aspects of a final theory;</div><div>since nature is not a concept,</div><div>  all concepts used in the final theory must be unobservable;</div><div>if something is observable, it means that it is a part of nature,</div><div>  and it is observed through interaction with other parts;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the following sentences quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller,</div><div>  describe it very well:</div><div>indeed there must be one and only one unobservable concept;</div><div>  if it was observable, the theory would not be final,</div><div>  if there were more unobservable concepts, the theory would be fiction, not science â€¦</div><div>in any unified theory, all the concepts that appear</div><div>  must be only approximately parts of the whole;</div><div>  thus we need an entity, describing nature</div><div>    which is not a set but which can be approximated by one;</div><div>for example, the approximation should yield a set of space points and a set of particles;</div><div>  but also, whenever we look at any part of nature, without any approximation,</div><div>  we should not be able to distinguish it from the whole world;</div><div>the simplest model would be a single entity which is extended and fluctuating,</div><div>  reaches spatial infinity, allows approximate localization,</div><div>  and thus allows approximate definition of parts and points;</div><div>in more vivid imagery, nature could be described by</div><div>  some deformable folded and tangled entity, a giant knotted amoeba;</div><div>  an amoeba slides between the fingers whenever one tries to grab a part of it;</div><div>  a perfect amoeba flows around any knife trying to cut it,</div><div>  the only way to hold it would be to grab it in its entirety;</div><div>  however, for someone himself made of amoeba strands, this is impossible;</div><div>  he can only grab it approximately, by catching part of it,</div><div>    and approximately blocking it, for example using a small hole,</div><div>    so that the escape takes a long time;</div><div>Strand Model proposed by Christoph Schiller is an attempt for</div><div>  the final unified theory of physics (it's discussed in the final chapter);</div><div><p></p></div><div>still, no matter how we describe nature, we are here as pretty evolved parts of it;</div><div>  in fact we are so evolved that we can alter the path of evolution itself;</div><div>  the problem is that we are not still evolved enough to use this ability properly;</div><div>we are going to create more suffering,</div><div>  and ultimately the destruction of all which has been achieved,</div><div>  if we continue what we are doing now; (excluding a few developed countries)</div><div>though it is possible that the evolution goes one step further,</div><div>  leading to humans that can add to the beauty and richness of nature;</div><div>  see "a new earth" by Eckhart Tolle;</div>
<h2>2, spacetime</h2><div>spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product;</div><div><p></p></div><div>vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts</div><div>  whose precise definitions can easily be found online;</div><div>a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is</div><div>  totally ordered, and has a complete metric;</div><div>  this means that the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers;</div><div><p></p></div><div>in a vector space with Minkowski inner product,</div><div>  all normal vectors (for which we have: v v = 1 or -1)</div><div>  are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:</div><div>    basis.i basis.j = g.i.j;</div><div>    g.i.j = if i=j=1 {-1} else if i=j {1} else {0};</div><div>vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:</div><div>  v.i = v basis.i;</div><div>thus the inner product can be written as: v1 v2 = g.i.j v1.i v2.j;</div><div>by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices;</div><div><p></p></div><div>transformations which leave the distance</div><div>  (ie (v2 - v1)^2\2 where "\" is rooting operation)</div><div>  invariant, are called symmetry transformations of spacetime;</div><div>they can be written as:</div><div>  vt.i = L.i.j v.j + v0.i;</div><div>  g.i.j L.i.k L.j.l = g.k.l;</div><div><p></p></div><div>symmetry transformations of spacetime, form a group called symmetry group of spacetime,</div><div>  which is a ten_parameter non_abelian Lie group;</div><div>so the representations of Lorentz group can be studied using the corresponding Lie group;</div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_a_Lie_group'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_a_Lie_group</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>non_relativistic physics (where instantanous action at a distace is possible),</div><div>  is a consistent theory;</div><div>Maxwell's equations which only deals with continuous currents,</div><div>  is a consistent theory too;</div><div>but point particles in a relativistic theory leads to infinite self_field</div><div>  (thus external finite fields can't accelerate the particle);</div><div>resolving these infinities needs renormalization, which is a phenomenological process,</div><div>  thus the resulting theory would not be fundamental;</div><div>"on radiation reaction and the Abraham_Lorentz_Dirac equation"</div><div>  <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2203.pdf'>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2203.pdf</a></div><div>"self_force on a classical point charge, Robert M.

interactions</b></div><div>strong and weak interactions (unlike electromagnetism) have very short ranges;</div><div>  thus in practice we always work with them in small scales</div><div>  and with relatively small number of quanta;</div><div><p></p></div><div>strong interaction is described by a SU(3) gauge symmetry</div><div>  (3rd order special unitary group,</div><div>    the set of all 3 by 3 unitary matrices with unit determinant);</div><div>it implies 8 gauge quanta which even interact with each other,</div><div>  leading to confinement, and thus the short range of strong interaction;</div><div><p></p></div><div>weak interaction is described by a broken SU(2) gauge symmetry;</div><div>the symmetry must be broken, otherwise weak interaction would have long ranges;</div><div>to explain this symmetry breaking, we need another quanta called Higgs boson;</div><div><a

time reversal symmetries,</div><div>  in weak interactions,</div><div>  is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles</div><div>  (not an asymmetry of spacetime itself);</div><div>in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles,</div><div>  seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries,</div><div>  because we are not considering their internal structures;</div><div>  in other words, CPT symmetry is not violated;</div><div>an important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that</div><div>  quantons have some kind of internal structure;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>hints to extended entities</b></div><div>this section (except the last paragraph) is quoted from</div><div>  "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller (<a href='http://www.motionmountain.net/'>http://www.motionmountain.net/</a>);</div><div><p></p></div><div>any particle that is smaller than its own Compton wavelength must be elementary;</div><div>  if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it;</div><div>  this lighter particle would have a larger Compton wavelength than the composite particle;</div><div>  this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle</div><div>    must be larger than the Compton wavelength of its components;</div><div>however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact;</div><div>  the difficulties of compact constituents were described by Andrei Sakharov in the 1960s;</div><div>if the constituents are extended, the previous argument does not apply,</div><div> as extended constituents have no localized mass;</div><div>as a result, if a flying arrow (Zeno's famous example) is made of extended constituents,</div><div>  it cannot be said to be at a given position at a given time;</div><div>  shortening the observation time towards the Planck time,</div><div>    makes an arrow disappear in the cloud that makes up spacetime;</div><div><p></p></div><div>in the strand model, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands;</div><div>in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter,</div><div>  strands are;</div><div>if particles could really be elementary,</div><div>  it would be impossible to understand their properties;</div><div>in the strand model, particles are not really elementary,</div><div>  but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed;</div><div>  particles are tangles of unobservable strands</div><div>in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle,</div><div>  but gets rid of its limitations;</div><div>if one wants to think radically, the strand model can be seen as,</div><div>  eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle;</div><div><p></p></div><div>a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century;</div><div>  any belt provides an example;</div><div>  any localized structure with any number of tails attached to it</div><div>    (tails that reach the border of the region of space under consideration)</div><div>    has the same properties as a spin 1/2 particle;</div><div>    the only condition is that the tails themselves are unobservable;</div><div>the tail model even has the same problems with highly curved space,</div><div>  as real spin 1/2 particles have;</div><div>it is a famous exercise to show that</div><div>  such a model is indeed invariant under 4Pi rotations, but not under 2Pi rotations;</div><div>  and that two such particles get entangled when exchanged,</div><div>    but get untangled when exchanged twice;</div><div>  the tail model thus confirms that rotation is partial exchange;</div><div>particles can have spin 1/2, provided that they have tails going to the border of space;</div><div>  if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work;</div><div>  spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension;</div><div><p></p></div><div>explaining blackhole entropy seems to demand extended entities too;</div><div><p></p></div><div>extended entities can even explain the 3 dimensionality of space too;</div><div>  space is 3 dimensional because it's the only number of dimensions in which knots are possible;</div><div>Zeeman proved that (considering topological isotopes, or even piecewise linear isotopes)</div><div>  spheres can make knots only when the co_dimension</div><div>  (the difference between the dimension of the sphere and the container space)</div><div>  is 2;</div><div>there is another phenomena which i think is related to this:</div><div>  exotic smooth structures exist only on R^4;</div><div>  ie when "n" is not 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to R^n is diffeomorphic to R^n;</div><div>i think the origin of this phenomena is the failure of the Whitney trick,</div><div>  which i think is because of the co_dimension 2,</div><div>  between 2_disks used in the Whitney trick,</div><div>  and the 4 dimensional space;</div>
<h2>4, Planck scales</h2><div>at extremely small scales of spacetime, called Planck scales,</div><div>  the mom_energy of quantum particles can be so high that black holes appear;</div><div>therefore at Planck scales, nature is not observable;</div><div>  spacetime is indistinguishable from particles and fields;</div><div>  they must be described by the same (unobservable) thing;</div><div>the rest of this section is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller;</div><div><p></p></div><div>general relativity and quantum theory contradict each other;</div><div>  in practice however, this happens only at Planck scales;</div><div>whenever we combine general relativity and quantum theory,</div><div>  the universe teaches us that it is not a set of parts;</div><div>for this reason, any sentence or expression containing the term "universe",</div><div>  is probably meaningless, whenever complete precision is required;</div><div>despite the contradictions between quantum theory and general relativity,</div><div>  the Planck limits (c, Ä§ and c^4/4*G) remain valid;</div><div>there is an intriguing relation between Planck scales and cosmological scales,</div><div>  they seem to pose the same challenges to their description;</div><div>  there is a tight relation between large and small scales in nature;</div><div>  there seems to be little difference (if any at all) between the universe and nothing;</div><div><p></p></div><div>elements and sets must be abandoned,</div><div>  this radical conclusion is deduced from only two statements:</div><div>  1, the necessity of using quantum theory</div><div>    whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Compton wavelength;</div><div>  2, and of using general relativity</div><div>    whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Schwarzschild radius;</div><div>  together, they mean that</div><div>    no precise description of nature can contain elements and sets;</div><div>the difficulties in complying with this result,</div><div>  explain why the unification of the two theories has not so far been successful;</div><div>not only does unification require that</div><div>  we stop using space, time and mass for the description of nature,</div><div>  it also requires that all distinctions, of any kind, should be only approximate;</div><div>  but all physicists have been educated on the basis of exactly the opposite creed;</div><div><p></p></div><div>combining quantum theory and general relativity</div><div>  leads us to several important results on the description of nature:</div><div>, the constituents of vacuum and particles cannot be points;</div><div>, there is no conceivable way to prove that points exist,</div><div>  as the smallest measurable distance in nature is the Planck length;</div><div>, vacuum and particles mix at Planck scales,</div><div>  as there is no conceivable way to distinguish whether</div><div>  a Planck sized region is part of a particle or of empty space;</div><div>, matter, radiation and vacuum cannot be distinguished at Planck scales,</div><div>  they are made of common constituents;</div><div>, particles, vacuum and continuous space do not exist at Planck scales,</div><div>  they disappear in a yet unclear Planck scale mixture;</div><div><p></p></div><div>distinguishing between two entities requires different measurement results;</div><div>  for example, different positions, masses or sizes;</div><div>whatever quantity we choose, at Planck energy the distinction becomes impossible;</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need a description of nature that allows us to state that</div><div>  at Planck energy nothing can be distinguished from anything else;</div><div>there is only one solution, everything</div><div>  (or at least, what we call "everything" in everyday life)</div><div>  must be made of the same single constituent;</div><div>every point in space, every event, every particle and every instant of time</div><div>  must be made of the same single constituent;</div>
<h2>5, Strand Model</h2><div><a href='http://motionmountain.com/research.html'>http://motionmountain.com/research.html</a></div><div>note that the explanation bellow is my personal thoughts,</div><div>  it completely differs from how Schiller presents his Strand Model;</div><div><p></p></div><div>vacuum is a web of straight strands;</div><div>any deformation in a strand transfers to the neighboring strands with the speed of light;</div><div>it takes an average time equal to Planck time for strands to reach each other,</div><div>  and the average distance between strands is equal to Planck length;</div><div>  so on average a simple deformation on a strand (called a photon)</div><div>    moves with the speed of light;</div><div>  and on average any change is equal to Planck action;</div><div><p></p></div><div>tangled deformations (made of two or three strands)</div><div>  move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light;</div><div>  they can change their (average) velocity by emitting photons;</div><div>tangles are not necessarily between adjacent strands,</div><div>  they can be between distant strands;</div><div>tangles (as well as photons) are not necessarily localizable,</div><div>  they get localized when they interact with baths;</div><div><p></p></div><div>some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones;</div><div>a tangle can be untangled with a mirror tangle, and produce high frequency photons;</div><div>mass is the amount of inter_tangledness,</div><div>  and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle,</div><div>  as well as the curvature of nearby vacuum strands;</div>
