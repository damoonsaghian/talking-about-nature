<h2>1, talking about nature</h2><div>talking is essentially nothing but separating and grouping, they are the foundation of all concepts</div><div>this is especially evident in mathematics (a way of talking, in which the relation between concepts is clear and thus the foundation of every concept is determined), the concept of a set (a group of parts) is the foundation of all mathematical concepts</div><div>the subtle point is that separating and grouping are circular concepts, each defined using the other (yin and yang)</div><div><p></p></div><div>nature (everything) can't be a set, in other words, there is no set of everything, because at least it can't contain itself</div><div>even if we define sets, in a way that they could be members of themselves, again a set of everything would not be possible</div><div>to see why, suppose that we have a set named set1, and set2 contains those sets in set1 that are not members of themselves</div><div>it turns out that set2 cannot be in set1, here is the proof</div><div>, suppose that set2 is in set1, set2 is either a member of itself or it is not</div><div>, if set2 is a member of itself then by its definition set2 must not be a member of set2, a contradiction</div><div>, if set2 is not a member of itself, since it is a member of set1 which is not a member of itself, set2 must be a member of set2, again a contradiction</div><div>this shows that no set contains everything because at least it can't contain set2, this is called Russell's paradox</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's the talking that must be contained in nature (e'g in the form of a brain) not the other way around</div><div>nature, universe, reality, everything, god, being, or whatever we call it, is not a group of parts, though it can be approximately described using sets, only the existence of approximate groups and parts in our brains allows us to talk about nature in general</div><div>so talking about nature, with approximate concepts, is possible, and indeed very useful, it's called physics</div><div><p></p></div><div>quantum theory and general relativity (discussed in the following chapters) are the best theories of physics we have at hand, two different ways to talk about two different areas of nature</div><div>it's only at extreme areas like Planck scales that they meet each other and this meeting turns out to be disastrous, and at the same time, a useful guide to a final unified theory (as discussed in the chapter on Planck scales)</div><div>we will see that quantum theory and general relativity when combined imply that at Planck scales nature can't be described with parts and groups, because at those scales the assumption that nature is a group of parts is not a good approximation any more</div><div><p></p></div><div>but even without mentioning quantum theory and general relativity, we can predict the main aspects of a final theory</div><div>since nature is not a concept, all concepts used in the final theory must be unobservable</div><div>if something is observable, it means that it is a part of nature, and it is observed through interaction with other parts</div><div>the following sentences quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller, describe it very well</div><div>indeed there must be one and only one unobservable concept</div><div>if it was observable, the theory would not be final, if there were more unobservable concepts, the theory would be fiction, not science ...</div><div>in any unified theory, all the concepts that appear must be only approximately parts of the whole, thus we need an entity, describing nature which is not a set but which can be approximated by one</div><div>for example, the approximation should yield a set of space points and a set of particles, but also, whenever we look at any part of nature, without any approximation, we should not be able to distinguish it from the whole world</div><div>if nature is to be described by a single constituent this entity must be extended, the entity has to be a single one, but it must seem to be multiple, it has to be multiple approximately, as nature shows multiple aspects</div><div>the entity must be something folded, it must be possible to count the folds, but only approximately</div><div>the simplest model would be a single entity which is extended and fluctuating, reaches spatial infinity, allows approximate localization, and thus allows approximate definition of parts and points</div><div>in more vivid imagery, nature could be described by some deformable folded and tangled entity, a giant, knotted amoeba, an amoeba slides between the fingers whenever one tries to grab a part of it, a perfect amoeba flows around any knife trying to cut it, the only way to hold it would be to grab it in its entirety, however, for someone himself made of amoeba strands, this is impossible, he can only grab it approximately, by catching part of it, and approximately blocking it, for example using a small hole, so that the escape takes a long time</div><div>strand model proposed by Christoph Schiller is an attempt for the final unified theory of physics (it's discussed in a following chapter)</div><div><p></p></div><div>still, no matter how we describe nature, we are here as pretty evolved parts of it, in fact we are so evolved that we can alter the path of evolution itself</div><div>the problem is that we are not still evolved enough to use this ability properly</div><div>in fact (excluding a few developed countries) we are going to create more suffering, and ultimately the destruction of all which has been achieved, if we continue what we are doing now</div><div>though it is possible that the evolution goes one step further, leading to humans that can add to the beauty and richness of nature, see "a new earth" by Eckhart Tolle</div>
<h2>2, spacetime, fields and particles</h2><div><b>spacetime</b></div><div>spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product</div><div>vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts whose precise definitions can be find easily on the internet</div><div>a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is totally ordered, and has a complete metric, i'e the field is isomorphic to real numbers</div><div><p></p></div><div>in a vector space with Minkowski inner product, all normal vectors (i'e v*v = +-1) are divided into distinct groups, called basis, for which we have</div><div>  basis_i * basis_j = g_i_j</div><div>  g_i_j = if i==j==0 then -1 elseif i==j then 1 else 0</div><div>vector components with respect to a basis are defined by</div><div>  v_i = v * basis_i</div><div>thus the inner product can be written as: v1*v2 == g_i_j * v1_i * v2_j</div><div>(by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices)</div><div><p></p></div><div>transformations which leave the distance i'e \sqrt((v2-v1)^2) invariant, are called symmetry transformations, they can be written as</div><div>v'_i = Λ_i_j * v_j + Λ0_i</div><div>g_i_j * Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l = g_k_l</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics)'>symmetry and physics</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group'>Lorentz group</a></div><div><p></p></div><div><b>fields</b></div><div>fields are functions on spacetime that transform linearly under symmetry transformations, this means that they transform according to a linear representation of the spacetime symmetry group</div><div>, scalar fields transform as: f'(x') = f(x)</div><div>, vector fields as: f'_i(x') = Λ_i_j * f_j(x)</div><div>, higher order tensor fields as</div><div>  f'_i_j_…(x') = Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l * … * f_k_l_…(x)</div><div>, spinor fields as</div><div>  ψ'_i(x') = S_i_j * ψ_j(x)</div><div>  γ_k_l_i * S_i_j = S_l_i * Λ_k_m * γ_m_i_j</div><div>  γ_i_k_l * γ_j_l_k + γ_i_k_l * γ_i_l_k = 2*g_i_j</div><div><p></p></div><div>free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field, i'e a superposition of plane waves (a free field is what we have when there is no interaction, like free particles which move with constant velocity)</div><div>  plain'wave(x) = a0 cos(g_i_j * p_i * x_j + phase0)</div><div>    where g_i_j * p_i * p_j &gt;= 0</div><div>we define mass as: m^2 = g_i_j * p_i * p_j</div><div>an example of a free field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, tensor or spinor) that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is</div><div>  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) + m^2 * f(x) = 0</div><div>in fact the most general form is</div><div>  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) - g_k_l * g_i_j * d_k d_l d_i d_j f(x) + ... +</div><div>    (m^2 + m^4 + ...)*f(x) = 0</div><div>  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations, is the result of inverse square law, which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space)</div><div>  (Ostrogradsky instability)</div><div>for spinor fields the equation is simplified to</div><div>  γ_i_k_l * d_i ψ_l(x) *I - m * ψ_k(x) = 0</div><div>  (I^2 = -1)</div><div><p></p></div><div>field equations have symmetry transformations that are not related to spacetime, for example multiplying the field by a constant number leaves the equation invariant, although this is a trivial property due to the equation being linear, it is a guide to nontrivial symmetries</div><div>we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation (spacetime dependent phase transformation) by introducing a gauge field, to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term</div><div>γ_i * d_i ψ(x) *I - m * ψ(x) = E * gf_i(x) * γ_i * ψ(x)</div><div>g_i_j * d_i d_j gf_k(x) = E * ψ(x)† * γ_0 * γ_k * ψ(x)</div><div>  († is conjugate transpose operator)</div><div>these equations describe how fields can interact with each other</div><div><p></p></div><div>uncertainty principle is a property of fields</div><div>Δx * Δk &gt;= 1/2</div><div>Δt * Δf &gt;= 1/2</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>particles</b></div><div>see "Asim Barut, electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle"</div><div><p></p></div><div>interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy for point particles which needs renormalization</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>gravity</b></div><div>spacetime is a geometric space, i'e it has geodesics which determine the motion of free particles (and fields) in it</div><div>free particles always move the same way, regardless of their mass</div><div><p></p></div><div>according to the equivalence principle of gravity, motion of particles (and fields) near a massive body, are the same, regardless of their mass</div><div>so the paths taken by falling bodies are the geodesics themselves</div><div>this means that in the presence of gravity, the geodesics are curved</div><div><p></p></div><div>for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry, there is a maximum curvature which can be reached when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2*g*m/c^2), this is called a black hole</div><div><p></p></div><div>i think dark energy is the result of activities at the border of space, so it's kind of a global feature of space, and can be interpreted as the cosmological constant</div><div>although cosmological constant is constant through space, but during the growth of the universe, when it's shape was different, the cosmological constant could had different values (e'g during inflation)</div><div><p></p></div><div>primordial black holes are a good dark matter candidate</div>
<h2>3, quantum physics</h2><div><b>quantum fields</b></div><div>experiments like the double'slit experiment, show that universe is made of discrete but extended entities called quantum fields</div><div>quantum fields must be entirely and instantaneously created or destroyed in discrete units (like particles), even though each unit is generally infinitely extended (like a field)</div><div><p></p></div><div>while the motion of quantum fields in spacetime can be described by a field equation, changes in quantum fields are quantized (not continuous), i'e they always interacts in discrete units</div><div>fields can be considered as the probability amplitude for interaction with another field (such as the electromagnetic field)</div><div>thus quantized fields, make the measurement (which relies on interactions), a probabilistic process</div><div>by a quantum measurement, we mean any process in which a quantum phenomenon causes a macroscopic change</div><div>the fact that everything even measurement tools have field behaviors, implies that measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty (because of the field's uncertainty mentioned in the previous chapter)</div><div>the measurement process always affects the quantum field subjected to it, and it is in principle impossible to make its effect arbitrarily small (for a given accuracy of measurement) the more exact the measurement, the stronger the effect exerted by it (because it demands stronger interaction) and only in measurements of very low accuracy, can the effect on the measured object be small</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://you.uark.edu/ahobson/'>Art Hobson, there are no particles, there are only fields</a></div><div><a href='https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~babis/Teaching/QFT1/qft1.pdf'>Babis Anastasiou, quantum field theory</a></div><div><a href='http://epx.phys.tohoku.ac.jp/~yhitoshi/particleweb/particle.html'>Hitoshi Yamamoto, quantum field theory</a></div><div><p></p></div><div><b>strong and weak interactions</b></div><div>in quantum chromodynamics (which describes strong forces) a generalization of Dirac equation is used that have s'u(3) internal symmetry (3rd order special unitary group, the set of all 3*3 unitary matrices with unit determinant) instead of the trivial u(1) internal symmetry</div><div>this equation implies the interaction between gauge fields themselves</div><div>but since in this approach, there is no rigorous explanation for confinement (yet), i think maybe it's better to describe strong force as a binding process, due to the internal structures of quantons, not as an interaction like electromagnetism</div><div><p></p></div><div>weak interaction explains how quantons can transmute to each other, it is described by a broken s'u(2) local gauge interaction</div><div>broken s'u(2) means that the weak bosons either turn into photons with u(1) gauge symmetry, or turn into massive bosons</div><div><p></p></div><div>the apparent violation of mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries, in weak interactions, is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles (not an asymmetry of spacetime itself)</div><div>in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries, because we are not considering their internal structures</div><div>an important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that quantons have some kind of internal structure</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>hints to extended entities</b></div><div>this section is quoted from <a href='http://www.motionmountain.net/'>Christoph Schiller, motion mountain</a></div><div>any particle that is smaller than its own Compton wavelength must be elementary</div><div>if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it, this lighter particle would have a larger Compton wavelength than the composite particle, this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle must be larger than the Compton wavelength of its components</div><div>however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact, the difficulties of compact constituents were described by Andrei Sakharov in the 1960s</div><div>if the constituents are extended, the previous argument does not apply, as extended constituents have no localized mass</div><div>as a result, if a flying arrow (Zeno's famous example) is made of extended constituents, it cannot be said to be at a given position at a given time, shortening the observation time towards the Planck time, makes an arrow disappear in the cloud that makes up spacetime</div><div><p></p></div><div>in the strand model, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands, in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter, strands are</div><div>if particles could really be elementary, it would be impossible to understand their properties</div><div>in the strand model, particles are not really elementary, but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed, particles are tangles of unobservable strands</div><div>in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle, but gets rid of its limitations</div><div>if one wants to think radically, the strand model can be seen as, eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle</div><div><p></p></div><div>a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century, any belt provides an example, any localized structure with any number of tails attached to it (tails that reach the border of the region of space under consideration) has the same properties as a spin 1/2 particle, the only condition is that the tails themselves are unobservable</div><div>the tail model even has the same problems with highly curved space, as real spin 1/2 particles have</div><div>it is a famous exercise to show that such a model is indeed invariant under 4*Pi rotations, but not under 2*Pi rotations, and that two such particles get entangled when exchanged, but get untangled when exchanged twice, the tail model thus confirms that rotation is partial exchange</div><div>particles can have spin 1/2, provided that they have tails going to the border of space, if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work, spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension</div><div><p></p></div><div>explaining blackhole entropy seems to demand extended entities too</div><div><p></p></div><div>extended entities can even explain the 3 dimensionality of space too, space is 3 dimensional because it's the only number of dimensions in which knots are possible</div><div>Zeeman proved that (considering topological isotopes, or even piecewise linear isotopes), spheres can make knots only when the co'dimension (the difference between the dimension of the sphere and the container space) is 2</div><div>there is another phenomena which i think is related to this</div><div>exotic smooth structures exist only on R^4, i'e when "n" is not 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to R^n is diffeomorphic to R^n</div><div>i think the origin of this phenomena is the failure of the Whitney trick, which i think is because of the co'dimension 2, between 2'disks used in the Whitney trick, and the 4 dimensional space</div>
<h2>4, Planck scales</h2><div>at extremely small scales of spacetime, called Planck scales, the mom'energy of quantum particles can be so high that black holes appear</div><div>therefore at Planck scales, nature is not observable, spacetime is indistinguishable from particles and fields, they must be described by the same (unobservable) thing</div><div>the rest of this section is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller</div><div><p></p></div><div>general relativity and quantum theory contradict each other, in practice however, this happens only at Planck scales</div><div>the reason for the contradiction is the insistence on a circular definition of space and particles, only the circular definition allows us to define points and point particles</div><div>in order to solve the contradictions and to understand nature at Planck scales, we must introduce common constituents for space and particles</div><div><p></p></div><div>elements and sets must be abandoned, this radical conclusion is deduced from only two statements</div><div>1, the necessity of using quantum theory whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Compton wavelength</div><div>2, and of using general relativity whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Schwarzschild radius</div><div>together, they mean that no precise description of nature can contain elements and sets</div><div>the difficulties in complying with this result explain why the unification of the two theories has not so far been successful</div><div>not only does unification require that we stop using space, time and mass for the description of nature, it also requires that all distinctions, of any kind, should be only approximate, but all physicists have been educated on the basis of exactly the opposite creed</div><div><p></p></div><div>whenever we combine general relativity and quantum theory, the universe teaches us that it is not a set of parts</div><div>for this reason, any sentence or expression containing the term "universe", is probably meaningless, whenever complete precision is required</div><div>we also learned that a description of nature without sets, solves the contradictions between general relativity and quantum theory</div><div>we also found, again, that despite the contradictions between quantum theory and general relativity, the Planck limits (c, ħ and c^4/4*G) remain valid</div><div>we then found an intriguing relation between Planck scales and cosmological scales, they seem to pose the same challenges to their description, there is a tight relation between large and small scales in nature, there seems to be little difference (if any at all) between the universe and nothing</div><div><p></p></div><div>combining quantum theory and general relativity leads us to several important results on the description of nature</div><div>, the constituents of vacuum and particles cannot be points</div><div>, there is no conceivable way to prove that points exist, as the smallest measurable distance in nature is the Planck length</div><div>, vacuum and particles mix at Planck scales, as there is no conceivable way to distinguish whether a Planck sized region is part of a particle or of empty space</div><div>, matter, radiation and vacuum cannot be distinguished at Planck scales, they are made of common constituents</div><div>, particles, vacuum and continuous space do not exist at Planck scales, they disappear in a yet unclear Planck scale mixture</div><div><p></p></div><div>distinguishing between two entities requires different measurement results, for example, different positions, masses or sizes</div><div>whatever quantity we choose, at Planck energy the distinction becomes impossible</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need a description of nature that allows us to state that at Planck energy nothing can be distinguished from anything else</div><div>there is only one solution, everything (or at least, what we call "everything" in everyday life) must be made of the same single constituent, all particles are made of one "piece", every point in space, every event, every particle and every instant of time must be made of the same single constituent</div>
<h2>5, strand model</h2><div><a href='http://motionmountain.com/research.html'>strand model</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>vacuum is a web of straight strands</div><div>any deformation in a strand transfers to the neighboring strands with the speed of light</div><div>it takes an average time equal to Planck time for strands to reach each other, and the average distance between strands is equal to Planck length, so on average a simple deformation on a strand (called a photon) moves with the speed of light, and on average any change is equal to Planck action</div><div><p></p></div><div>tangled deformations (made of two or three strands) move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light, they can change their (average) velocity by emitting photons</div><div>tangles are not necessarily between adjacent strands, they can be between distant strands, tangles (as well as photons) are not necessarily localizable, they get localized when they interact with baths</div><div>some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones</div><div>a tangle can be untangled with a mirror tangle, and produce high frequency photons</div><div>mass is the amount of inter'tangledness, and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle, as well as the curvature of nearby vacuum strands</div><div><p></p></div><div>for lack of a better name, i call it the "tao", it flows through all things, inside and outside, and returns to the origin of all things (from "tao te ching")</div></body></html>
