<h2>1, talking about nature</h2><div>talking is essentially nothing but separating and grouping, they are the foundation of all concepts</div><div>this is especially evident in mathematics (a way of talking, in which the relation between concepts is clear and thus the foundation of every concept is determined), the concept of a set (a group of parts) is the foundation of all mathematical concepts</div><div>the subtle point is that separating and grouping are circular concepts, each defined using the other (yin and yang)</div><div><p></p></div><div>nature (everything) can't be a set, in other words, there is no set of everything, because at least it can't contain itself</div><div>even if we define sets, in a way that they could be members of themselves, again a set of everything would not be possible</div><div>to see why, suppose that we have a set named set1, and set2 contains those sets in set1 that are not members of themselves</div><div>it turns out that set2 cannot be in set1, here is the proof</div><div>, suppose that set2 is in set1, set2 is either a member of itself or it is not</div><div>, if set2 is a member of itself then by its definition set2 must not be a member of set2, a contradiction</div><div>, if set2 is not a member of itself, since it is a member of set1 which is not a member of itself, set2 must be a member of set2, again a contradiction</div><div>this shows that no set contains everything because at least it can't contain set2, this is called Russell's paradox</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's the talking that must be contained in nature (e'g in the form of a brain) not the other way around</div><div>nature, universe, reality, everything, god, being, or whatever we call it, is not a group of parts, though it can be approximately described using sets, only the existence of approximate groups and parts in our brains allows us to talk about nature in general</div><div>so talking about nature, with approximate concepts, is possible, and indeed very useful, it's called physics</div><div><p></p></div><div>quantum theory and general relativity (discussed in the following chapters) are the best theories of physics we have at hand, two different ways to talk about two different areas of nature</div><div>it's only at extreme areas like Planck scales that they meet each other and this meeting turns out to be disastrous, and at the same time, a useful guide to a final unified theory (as discussed in the chapter on Planck scales)</div><div>we will see that quantum theory and general relativity when combined imply that at Planck scales nature can't be described with parts and groups, because at those scales the assumption that nature is a group of parts is not a good approximation any more</div><div><p></p></div><div>but even without mentioning quantum theory and general relativity, we can predict the main aspects of a final theory</div><div>since nature is not a concept, all concepts used in the final theory must be unobservable</div><div>if something is observable, it means that it is a part of nature, and it is observed through interaction with other parts</div><div>the following sentences quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller, describe it very well</div><div>indeed there must be one and only one unobservable concept</div><div>if it was observable, the theory would not be final, if there were more unobservable concepts, the theory would be fiction, not science ...</div><div>in any unified theory, all the concepts that appear must be only approximately parts of the whole, thus we need an entity, describing nature which is not a set but which can be approximated by one</div><div>for example, the approximation should yield a set of space points and a set of particles, but also, whenever we look at any part of nature, without any approximation, we should not be able to distinguish it from the whole world</div><div>if nature is to be described by a single constituent this entity must be extended, the entity has to be a single one, but it must seem to be multiple, it has to be multiple approximately, as nature shows multiple aspects</div><div>the entity must be something folded, it must be possible to count the folds, but only approximately</div><div>the simplest model would be a single entity which is extended and fluctuating, reaches spatial infinity, allows approximate localization, and thus allows approximate definition of parts and points</div><div>in more vivid imagery, nature could be described by some deformable folded and tangled entity, a giant, knotted amoeba, an amoeba slides between the fingers whenever one tries to grab a part of it, a perfect amoeba flows around any knife trying to cut it, the only way to hold it would be to grab it in its entirety, however, for someone himself made of amoeba strands, this is impossible, he can only grab it approximately, by catching part of it, and approximately blocking it, for example using a small hole, so that the escape takes a long time</div><div>strand model proposed by Christoph Schiller is an attempt for the final unified theory of physics (it's discussed in a following chapter)</div><div><p></p></div><div>still, no matter how we describe nature, we are here as pretty evolved parts of it, in fact we are so evolved that we can alter the path of evolution itself</div><div>the problem is that we are not still evolved enough to use this ability properly</div><div>in fact (excluding a few developed countries) we are going to create more suffering, and ultimately the destruction of all that has been achieved, if we continue what we are doing now</div><div>though it is possible that the evolution goes one step further, leading to humans that can add to the beauty and richness of nature, see "a new earth" by Eckhart Tolle</div>
<h2>2, spacetime, fields and particles</h2><div><b>spacetime</b></div><div>spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product</div><div>vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts whose precise definitions can be find easily on the internet</div><div>real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is totally ordered, and has a complete metric, i'e the field is isomorphic to real numbers</div><div><p></p></div><div>in a vector space with Minkowski inner product</div><div>, there exists arrays of vectors (called orthonormal vectors) for which</div><div>  ov_i * ov_j = g_i_j</div><div>  g_i_j = if i==j==0 then -1 elseif i==j then 1 else 0</div><div>, the maximum number of orthonormal vectors is 4</div><div>an array of 4 mutually orthonormal vectors, is called an orthonormal basis of the 4 dimensional vector space</div><div>  (orthonormal basis is guaranteed to exist in the case of finite dimensions or when the vector space is complete, which both cases are true for spacetime)</div><div><p></p></div><div>vector components with respect to an orthonormal basis are defined by</div><div>  v_i = v * ov_i</div><div>thus the inner product can be written as: v1*v2 == g_i_j * v1_i * v2_j</div><div>  (by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices)</div><div><p></p></div><div>transformations which leave the distance i'e \sqrt((v2-v1)^2) invariant, are called symmetry transformations, they can be written as</div><div>v'_i = Λ_i_j * v_j + Λ0_i</div><div>g_i_j * Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l = g_k_l</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics)'>symmetry and physics</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group'>Lorentz group</a></div><div><p></p></div><div><b>fields</b></div><div>fields are functions on spacetime that transform linearly under symmetry transformations, this means that they transform according to a linear representation of the spacetime symmetry group</div><div>, scalar fields transform as: f'(x') = f(x)</div><div>, vector fields as: f'_i(x') = Λ_i_j * f_j(x)</div><div>, higher order tensor fields as</div><div>  f'_i_j_…(x') = Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l * … * f_k_l_…(x)</div><div>, spinor fields as</div><div>  ψ'_i(x') = S_i_j * ψ_j(x)</div><div>  γ_k_l_i * S_i_j = S_l_i * Λ_k_m * γ_m_i_j</div><div>  γ_i_k_l * γ_j_l_k + γ_i_k_l * γ_i_l_k = 2*g_i_j</div><div><p></p></div><div>free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field, i'e a superposition of plane waves (a free field is what we have when there is no interaction, like free particles which move with constant velocity)</div><div>  plain'wave(x) = a0 cos(g_i_j * p_i * x_j + ph0)</div><div>  where g_i_j * p_i * p_j &gt;= 0</div><div>we define mass as: m^2 = g_i_j * p_i * p_j</div><div>an example of a free field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, tensor or spinor) that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is</div><div>  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) + m^2 * f(x) = 0</div><div>in fact the most general form for is</div><div>  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) - g_k_l * g_i_j * d_k d_l d_i d_j f(x) + ... +</div><div>    (m^2 + m^4 + ...)*f(x) = 0</div><div>  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations, is the result of inverse square law, which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space)</div><div>  (Ostrogradsky instability)</div><div>for spinor fields the equation is simplified to (I^2 = -1)</div><div>  γ_i_k_l * d_i ψ_l(x) *I - m * ψ_k(x) = 0</div><div><p></p></div><div>field equations have symmetry transformations that are not related to spacetime, for example multiplying the field by a constant number leaves the equation invariant, although this is a trivial property due to the equation being linear, it is a guide to nontrivial symmetries</div><div>we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation (spacetime dependent phase transformation) by introducing a gauge field, to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term</div><div>γ_i * d_i ψ(x) *I -m * ψ(x) = E * gf_i(x) * γ_i * ψ(x)</div><div>g_i_j * d_i d_j gf_k(x) = E * ψ(x)† * γ_0 * γ_k * ψ(x)</div><div>  († is conjugate transpose operator)</div><div>these equations describe how fields can interact with each other</div><div><p></p></div><div>uncertainty principle is a property of fields</div><div>Δx * Δk &gt;= 1/2</div><div>Δt * Δf &gt;= 1/2</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>classical physics is inconsistent</b></div><div>see "Asim Barut, electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle"</div><div>the discussion about self energy of point particles at the end of this book is briefly presented below, but the discussion seems unnecessary if we see classical theory of particles and fields, only as an approximation (which can be even inconsistent) of quantum theory (which is consistent and renormalizable, neglecting gravity of course)</div><div><p></p></div><div>interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy for point particles which its renormalization leads to non causal effects</div><div>each electron is located in a place where there is an infinite force of repulsion against electrons</div><div>we might simply declare that although the force of repulsion on a charged particle from its own field is infinite, it is equally infinite in all directions, so the infinite forces cancel out, leaving no net force on the particle due to its own field, at least if the particle is in uniform motion</div><div>then we can further suppose that the acceleration of a charged particle causes it to bias this singularity as it overtakes its own field, thereby incurring a net force (which can be made finite by mass renormalization), this same disturbance of the field results in radiation, so we can see the expected correlation between radiation and reaction</div><div>however, this approach leads to some highly nonIntuitive conclusions. for one thing, the equation of motion based on this premise seems to imply that, a uniformly accelerating charge does not radiate at all, even more disquieting, we find that the equations of motion for a free charged particle, possess run-away solutions, in which the particle rapidly accelerates toward the speed of light, in effect the particle is surfing on its own field</div><div>there is another way to get rid of infinite self'energy, but it leads to non'causal effects</div><div>we could point out that an electron does not interact with its own field, it interacts only with the fields of other particles</div><div>if we take this approach we must then explain why a charged particle resists changes in its state of motion, more strongly than an uncharged particle of the same inertial mass, the traditional account of accelerated charges tell us that this radiation reaction force applied through the particle's motion supplies the energy that is radiated away in the form of electromagnetic waves</div><div>the origin of this force is usually taken to be the interaction of the particle with its own field, thus if we declare that charged particles do not interact with their own fields, we need a different explanation for radiation reaction</div><div>one wellKnown candidate is the Wheeler'Feynman absorber theory, according to which the excess resistance of a charged particle, to changes in its state of motion is due to advanced waves emanating backwards in time, from an all encompassing array of absorbers in the future, whose waves are excited by the retarded waves emanating forwards in time from the particle</div><div>note that a field is necessarily both absorbed and emitted, if it were not, we would have no experience of it, it is only the emission and absorption events that are observable, not the existence of some entity in transit</div>
<h2>3, gravity and curved spacetime</h2><div>gravity has the basic property that all bodies move in it in the same manner, independent of mass, provided the initial conditions are the same</div><div>this property of gravitational fields provides the possibility of establishing an analogy between the motion of a body in a gravitational field, and the motion of a body not located in any external field, but which is considered from the point of view of a noninertial system of reference</div><div>namely, in an inertial reference system, the free motion of all bodies is uniform and rectilinear, and if, say, at the initial time their velocities are the same, they will be the same for all times</div><div>clearly, therefore, if we consider this motion in a given noninertial system then relative to this system all the bodies will move in the same way</div><div>thus the properties of the motion in a noninertial system are the same as those in an inertial system in the presence of a gravitational field</div><div>in other words, a non inertial reference system is equivalent to a certain gravitational field, this is called the principle of equivalence</div><div>however, the fields to which non'inertial reference systems are equivalent are not completely identical with actual gravitational fields, which occur also in inertial frames, for there is a very essential difference with respect to their behavior at infinity</div><div>at infinite distances from the bodies producing the field actual gravitational fields always go to zero</div><div>contrary to this, the fields to which noninertial frames are equivalent, increase without limit at infinity, or, in any event, remain finite in value</div><div>thus, for example, the centrifugal force which appears in a rotating reference system increases without limit as we move away from the axis of rotation</div><div>the field to which a reference system in accelerated linear motion is equivalent is the same  over all space and also at infinity</div><div>the fields to which non inertial systems are equivalent vanish as soon as we transform to an inertial system</div><div>in contrast to this, actual gravitational fields (existing also in an inertial reference frame) cannot be eliminated by any choice of reference system</div><div>this is already clear from what has been said above, concerning the difference in conditions at infinity between actual gravitational fields and fields to which non inertial systems are equivalent</div><div>since the latter do not approach zero at infinity, it is clear that it is impossible by any choice of reference frame to eliminate an actual field, since it vanishes at infinity</div><div>the fundamental property of gravitational fields that all bodies move in them in the same way, remains valid also in relativistic mechanics</div><div>consequently there remains also the analogy between gravitational fields and non inertial reference systems</div><div>upon transforming to any other inertial reference system (i'e under Lorentz transformation) the interval, retains the same form</div><div>however, if we transform to a nonInertial system of reference, the interval will no longer be a sum of squares of the four coordinate differentials</div><div>thus in a noninertial system of reference the spacetime metric (g_i_j) is symmetric, and is a certain function of spacetime</div><div>the same applies also to actual gravitational fields</div><div>any gravitational field is just a change in the metric of spacetime, as in nonrelativistic mechanics, there is a fundamental difference between actual gravitational fields and fields to which non inertial reference systems are equivalent</div><div>upon transforming to a non inertial reference system, the metric is obtained from the Lorentzian one by a simple transformation of coordinates, and can be reduced over all space to their lorentzian values, by the inverse coordinate transformation</div><div>that such forms for g_i_j are very special is clear from the fact that it is impossible by a mere transformation of the four coordinates to bring the ten quantities g_i_j to a pre'assigned form</div><div>an actual gravitational field cannot be eliminated by any transformation of coordinates</div><div>In other words, in the presence of a gravitational field spacetime is such that the quantities g_i_j determining its metric cannot, by any coordinate transformation, be brought to their lorentzian values over all space, such a spacetime is said to be curved, in contrast to flat spacetime  where such a reduction is possible</div><div>by an appropriate choice of coordinates, we can, however, bring the quantities g_i_j to lorentzian form at any individual point of the non'lorentzian spacetime, such a coordinate system is said to be lorentzian for the given point</div><div>a simple argument shows pictorially that space will become nonEuclidean when we change to a non'inertial system of reference</div><div>let us consider two reference frames, of which one (k1) is inertial, while the other (k2) rotates uniformly with respect to k1 around their common z axis</div><div>a circle in the x1'y1 plane of the k1 system (with its center at the origin) can also be regarded as a circle in the x2'y2 plane of the k2 system</div><div>measuring the length of the circle and its diameter with a yardstick in the k1 system, we obtain values whose ratio is equal to Pi, in accordance with the euclidean character of the geometry in the inertial reference system</div><div>now let the measurement be carried out with a yardstick at rest relative to k2</div><div>observing this process from the k1 system, we find that the yardstick laid along the circumference suffers a Lorentz contraction, whereas the yardstick placed radially is not changed</div><div>it is therefore clear that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, obtained from such a measurement, will be greater than Pi </div><div>in the general case of an arbitrary, varying gravitational field, the metric of space is not only non'euclidean, but also varies with the time</div><div>as a result, the relative position of test bodies introduced into the field, cannot remain unchanged in any coordinate system</div><div>thus if the particles are placed around the circumference of a circle and along a diameter, since the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is not equal to and changes with time, it is clear that if the separations of the particles along the diameter remain unchanged, the separations around the circumference must change, and conversely</div><div>thus in the general theory of relativity it is impossible in general, to have a system of bodies which are fixed relative to one another</div><div>this result essentially changes the very concept of a system of reference, in the general theory of relativity, as compared to its meaning in the special theory</div><div>in the latter we meant by a reference system a set of bodies at rest relative to one another</div><div>  in unchanging relative positions</div><div>such systems of bodies do not exist in the presence of a variable gravitational field, and for the exact determination of the position of a particle in space we must, strictly speaking, have an infinite number of bodies which fill all the space, like some sort of medium</div><div>such a system of bodies with arbitrarily running clocks fixed on them, constitutes a reference system in the general theory of relativity</div><div>in connection with the arbitrariness of the choice of a reference system, the laws of nature must be written in the general theory of relativity, in a form which is appropriate to any fourDimensional system of coordinates (or, as one says, in covariant form)</div><div>this, of course, does not imply the physical equivalence of all these reference systems (like the physical equivalence of all inertial reference systems in the special theory)</div><div>on the contrary, the specific appearances of physical phenomena, including the properties of the motion of bodies, become different in all systems of reference</div><div><p></p></div><div>if an observer is under the influence of electromagnetic forces, he can perform an experiment which makes him aware of the presence of the force, because bodies with different charges have different accelerations in the field, thus the observer can observe an acceleration for particles with charges less or greater than its own</div><div>but this is not true in the case of gravity, because gravitational charge is the mass itself</div><div>this is called equivalence of free fall and inertial motion, or equivalence of the mass (inertial mass) and gravitational charge (gravitational mass), or equivalence of gravitation and accelerated reference</div><div>in addition according to special relativity, energy is equivalent to (inertial) mass, so light have to lose energy when it rises in a gravitational field, since otherwise it can be turned into (inertial which then is equal to gravitational) mass, and through falling, gain an extra energy, leading to creation of energy from nothing</div><div>thus rising light is gravitationally redshifted, this shows that gravitation acts like local spacetime transformations, and it implies the curvature of spacetime</div><div>thus spacetime is not just a background for the motion of matter (massive bodies), but is itself influenced (curved) by it</div><div>for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry there is a maximum curvature which can be reached when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2*g*m/c^2), this is called a black hole</div>
<h2>4, quantum physics</h2><div><b>quantum fields</b></div><div>let us imagine a screen impermeable to electrons, in which two slits are cut</div><div>on observing the passage of a beam of electrons through one of the slits (the other being covered) we obtain, on a continuous screen placed behind the slit, some pattern of intensity distribution</div><div>on observing the passage of the beam through both slits, we should expect, on the basis of ordinary classical ideas, a pattern which is a simple superposition of the other two, each electron, moving in its path, passes through one of the slits, and has no effect on the electrons passing through the other slit</div><div>however, in reality we obtain a diffraction pattern  which, owing to interference, does not at all correspond to the sum of the patterns given by each slit separately</div><div>it is clear that this result can in no way be reconciled with the idea that electrons move in paths</div><div>experiments like this show that universe is made of discrete but extended entities called quantum fields</div><div>quantum fields must be entirely and instantaneously created or destroyed in discrete units (like particles), even though each unit is generally infinitely extended (unlike a particle)</div><div>changes in the field are quantized (not continuous)</div><div><p></p></div><div>while the motion of quantum fields in spacetime can be described by a field equation, quantum fields always interacts in discrete units</div><div>thus a field (such as the dirac field) can be considered as the probability amplitude for interaction with another field (such as the electromagnetic field)</div><div>thus the field particle duality makes the measurement (which relies on interactions), a probabilistic process</div><div>by a quantum measurement, we mean any process in which a quantum phenomenon causes a macroscopic change</div><div>the fact that everything even measurement tools have field behaviours, implies that measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty (because of the field's uncertainty mentioned earlier)</div><div>the discrete entities of a quantum field have no independent dynamical characteristic</div><div>dynamical characteristics of the electron appear only as a result of the measurement itself</div><div>thus the measurement process always affects the quantum field subjected to it, and it is in principle impossible to make its effect arbitrarily small (for a given accuracy of measurement) the more exact the measurement, the stronger the effect exerted by it (because it demands stronger interaction) and only in measurements of very low accuracy, can the effect on the measured object be small</div><div><a href='https://you.uark.edu/ahobson/'>Art Hobson, there are no particles, there are only fields</a></div><div><a href='https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~babis/Teaching/QFT1/qft1.pdf'>Babis Anastasiou, quantum field theory</a></div><div><a href='http://epx.phys.tohoku.ac.jp/~yhitoshi/particleweb/particle.html'>Hitoshi Yamamoto, quantum field theory</a></div><div><p></p></div><div><b>strong and weak interactions</b></div><div>in quantum chromodynamics (which describes strong forces) a generalization of Dirac equation is used that have s'u(3) internal symmetry (3rd order special unitary group, the set of all 3*3 unitary matrices with unit determinant) instead of the trivial u1 internal symmetry</div><div>this equation implies the interaction between gauge fields themselves</div><div>but since in this approach, there is no rigorous explanation (yet) for confinement, i think maybe it's better to describe strong force as a binding process, due to the internal structures of quantons, not as an interaction like electromagnetism</div><div><p></p></div><div>weak interaction is nothing but the decay of unstable quantons to stable ones, it is described by a broken s'u(2) local gauge interaction</div><div>broken s'u(2) means that the weak bosons either turn into photons with u1 gauge symmetry, or turn into massive bossons</div><div><p></p></div><div>the apparent violation of mirror inversion or time reversal symmetries in weak interactions is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles (not an asymmetry of spacetime itself)</div><div>in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries</div><div>an important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that quantons have some kind of internal structure</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>hints to extended entities</b></div><div>any particle that is smaller than its own compton wavelength must be elementary</div><div>if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it, this lighter particle would have a larger compton wavelength than the composite particle, this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle must be larger than the compton wavelength of its components</div><div>however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact</div><div>the difficulties of compact constituents were described by Andrei Sakharov in the 1960s</div><div>if the constituents are extended, the previous argument does not apply, as extended constituents have no localized mass</div><div>as a result, if a flying arrow (Zeno's famous example) is made of extended constituents, it cannot be said to be at a given position at a given time</div><div>  shortening the observation time towards the Planck time, makes an arrow disappear in the cloud that makes up spacetime</div><div><p></p></div><div>in the strand model, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands</div><div>in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter, strands are</div><div>if particles could really be elementary, it would be impossible to understand their properties</div><div>in the strand model, particles are not really elementary, but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed, particles are tangles of unobservable strands</div><div>in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle, but gets rid of its limitations</div><div>if one wants to think radically, the strand model can be seen as, eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle</div><div><p></p></div><div>a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century, any belt provides an example, any localized structure with any number of tails attached to it (tails that reach the border of the region of space under consideration) has the same properties as a spin 1/2 particle, the only condition is that the tails themselves are unobservable</div><div>the tail model even has the same problems with highly curved space, as real spin 1/2 particles have</div><div>it is a famous exercise to show that such a model is indeed invariant under 4 Pi rotations, but not under 2 Pi rotations, and that two such particles get entangled when exchanged, but get untangled when exchanged twice, the tail model thus confirms that rotation is partial exchange</div><div>particles can have spin 1/2 provided that they have tails going to the border of space, if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work</div><div>spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension</div><div><p></p></div><div>this section was quoted from <a href='http://www.motionmountain.net/'>Christoph Schiller, motion mountain</a></div>
<h2>5, Planck scales</h2><div>theories of quantum gravity predict infinite forces and other absurdities, the source of this problem was that quantum field theories had always assumed an individual quantum could, at sufficiently large energies, be squeezed down to an arbitrarily small size, because large energies imply large masses, this point'like nature of quanta at high energies implies infinities that ruin the theory</div><div>at extremely small scales of spacetime, called Planck scales, the momenergy of quantum particles can be so high that black holes appear</div><div>therefore at Planck scales, nature is not observable, spacetime is indistinguishable from particles and fields, they must be described by the same (unobservable) thing</div><div>the rest of this section is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller</div><div><p></p></div><div>general relativity and quantum theory contradict each other, in practice however, this happens only at Planck scales</div><div>the reason for the contradiction is the insistence on a circular definition of space and particles, only the circular definition allows us to define points and point particles</div><div>in order to solve the contradictions and to understand nature at Planck scales, we must introduce common constituents for space and particles</div><div><p></p></div><div>elements and sets must be abandoned</div><div>note that this radical conclusion is deduced from only two statements</div><div>, the necessity of using quantum theory whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Compton wavelength</div><div>, and of using general relativity whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Schwarzschild radius</div><div>together, they mean that no precise description of nature can contain elements and sets</div><div>the difficulties in complying with this result explain why the unification of the two theories has not so far been successful</div><div>not only does unification require that we stop using space, time and mass for the description of nature, it also requires that all distinctions, of any kind, should be only approximate, but all physicists have been educated on the basis of exactly the opposite creed</div><div><p></p></div><div>whenever we combine general relativity and quantum theory, the universe teaches us that it is not a set of parts</div><div>for this reason, any sentence or expression containing the term "universe", is probably meaningless, whenever complete precision is required</div><div>we also learned that a description of nature without sets, solves the contradictions between general relativity and quantum theory</div><div>we also found, again, that despite the contradictions between quantum theory and general relativity, the Planck limits (c, ħ and c^4/4*G) remain valid</div><div>we then found an intriguing relation between Planck scales and cosmological scales, they seem to pose the same challenges to their description, there is a tight relation between large and small scales in nature, there seems to be little difference (if any at all) between the universe and nothing</div><div><p></p></div><div>combining quantum theory and general relativity leads us to several important results</div><div>  on the description of nature, the constituents of vacuum and particles cannot be points</div><div>there is no conceivable way to prove that points exist, as the smallest measurable distance in nature is the Planck length</div><div>vacuum and particles mix at Planck scales, as there is no conceivable way to distinguish</div><div>  whether a Planck sized region is part of a particle or of empty space</div><div>matter, radiation and vacuum cannot be distinguished at Planck scales, they are made of common constituents</div><div>particles, vacuum and continuous space do not exist at Planck scales, they disappear in a yet unclear Planck scale mixture</div><div><p></p></div><div>distinguishing between two entities requires different measurement results, for example, different positions, masses or sizes</div><div>whatever quantity we choose, at Planck energy the distinction becomes impossible, only at everyday energies is it approximately possible</div><div><p></p></div><div>whatever observable is chosen, at the Planck energy the distinction becomes impossible, because of the large measurement errors</div><div><p></p></div><div>vacuum and particles must not differ at Planck scales, because of limits of measurement precision</div><div>vacuum and particles therefore must be described by common fundamental constituents</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need a description of nature that allows us to state that at Planck energy nothing can be distinguished from anything else</div><div>for example, it must be impossible to distinguish particles from each other, or from the vacuum</div><div>there is only one solution, everything (or at least, what we call "everything" in everyday life) must be made of the same single constituent, all particles are made of one "piece", every point in space, every event, every particle and every instant of time must be made of the same single constituent</div><div><p></p></div><div>if we exclude gauge interactions, we can summarize the rest of physics in a few limit statements</div><div>, the speed limit is equivalent to special relativity</div><div>, the force limit to general relativity</div><div>, the action limit to quantum theory</div><div>, the entropy limit to thermodynamics</div><div>, the distance limit to cosmology</div><div>these limits are observer invariant</div><div>the invariant limits imply that in nature every physical observable is bound on one end by the corresponding (corrected) Planck unit, and on the other end by a cosmological limit</div><div>the existence of lower and upper limit values to all observables implies that measurement precision is limited</div><div>as a consequence, matter and vacuum are indistinguishable, the description of spacetime as a continuous manifold is not correct, and nature can be described by sets only approximately</div><div>a natural way to avoid the use of sets is a description of empty space, radiation and matter</div><div>  as being made of common constituents</div><div><p></p></div><div>in order to reproduce three dimensional space, Planck units, spin, and black hole entropy</div><div>  the fundamental constituents must be extended</div><div><p></p></div><div>twentieth century physics deduced several invariant properties of motion, these invariants, such as the speed of light or the quantum of action are called Planck units</div><div>the invariant Planck units allow motion to be measured</div><div>above all, these invariants are also found to be limit values valid for every example of motion</div><div>combining quantum theory and general relativity, we discover that at the Planck limits the universe, space and particles are not described by points</div><div>we find that as long as we use points to describe particles and space, and as long as we use sets and elements to describe nature, a unified description of motion is impossible</div><div>the combination of quantum theory and general relativity teaches us that space and particles have common constituents</div><div>by exploring black holes, spin, and the limits of quantum theory and gravity we discover that the common constituents of space and particles are fluctuating, extended, without ends, and one'dimensional, the common constituents of space and particles are fluctuating strands</div><div>we discover that we cannot think or talk without continuity, we need a background to describe nature</div><div>we conclude that to talk about motion, we have to combine continuity and non'continuity in an appropriate way, this is achieved by imagining that fluctuating strands move in a continuous three dimensional background</div>
