gravity has the basic property that all bodies move in it in the same manner, independent of mass, provided the initial conditions are the same
this property of gravitational fields provides the possibility of establishing an analogy between the motion of a body in a gravitational field, and the motion of a body not located in any external field, but which is considered from the point of view of a noninertial system of reference
namely, in an inertial reference system, the free motion of all bodies is uniform and rectilinear, and if, say, at the initial time their velocities are the same, they will be the same for all times
clearly, therefore, if we consider this motion in a given noninertial system then relative to this system all the bodies will move in the same way
thus the properties of the motion in a noninertial system are the same as those in an inertial system in the presence of a gravitational field
in other words, a non inertial reference system is equivalent to a certain gravitational field, this is called the principle of equivalence
however, the fields to which non'inertial reference systems are equivalent are not completely identical with actual gravitational fields, which occur also in inertial frames, for there is a very essential difference with respect to their behavior at infinity
at infinite distances from the bodies producing the field actual gravitational fields always go to zero
contrary to this, the fields to which noninertial frames are equivalent, increase without limit at infinity, or, in any event, remain finite in value
thus, for example, the centrifugal force which appears in a rotating reference system increases without limit as we move away from the axis of rotation
the field to which a reference system in accelerated linear motion is equivalent is the same  over all space and also at infinity
the fields to which non inertial systems are equivalent vanish as soon as we transform to an inertial system
in contrast to this, actual gravitational fields (existing also in an inertial reference frame) cannot be eliminated by any choice of reference system
this is already clear from what has been said above, concerning the difference in conditions at infinity between actual gravitational fields and fields to which non inertial systems are equivalent
since the latter do not approach zero at infinity, it is clear that it is impossible by any choice of reference frame to eliminate an actual field, since it vanishes at infinity
the fundamental property of gravitational fields that all bodies move in them in the same way, remains valid also in relativistic mechanics
consequently there remains also the analogy between gravitational fields and non inertial reference systems
upon transforming to any other inertial reference system (i'e under 'lorentz transformation) the interval, retains the same form
however, if we transform to a nonInertial system of reference, the interval will no longer be a sum of squares of the four coordinate differentials
thus in a noninertial system of reference the spacetime metric (g'ij) is symmetric, and is a certain function of spacetime
the same applies also to actual gravitational fields
any gravitational field is just a change in the metric of spacetime, as in nonrelativistic mechanics, there is a fundamental difference between actual gravitational fields and fields to which non inertial reference systems are equivalent
upon transforming to a non inertial reference system, the metric is obtained from the 'lorentzian one by a simple transformation of coordinates, and can be reduced over all space to their lorentzian values, by the inverse coordinate transformation
that such forms for g'ij are very special is clear from the fact that it is impossible by a mere transformation of the four coordinates to bring the ten quantities g'ij to a pre'assigned form
an actual gravitational field cannot be eliminated by any transformation of coordinates
In other words, in the presence of a gravitational field spacetime is such that the quantities g'ij determining its metric cannot, by any coordinate transformation, be brought to their lorentzian values over all space, such a spacetime is said to be curved, in contrast to flat spacetime  where such a reduction is possible
by an appropriate choice of coordinates, we can, however, bring the quantities g'ij to lorentzian form at any individual point of the non'lorentzian spacetime, such a coordinate system is said to be lorentzian for the given point
a simple argument shows pictorially that space will become nonEuclidean when we change to a non'inertial system of reference
let us consider two reference frames, of which one (k1) is inertial, while the other (k2) rotates uniformly with respect to k1 around their common z axis
a circle in the x1'y1 plane of the k1 system (with its center at the origin) can also be regarded as a circle in the x2'y2 plane of the k2 system
measuring the length of the circle and its diameter with a yardstick in the k1 system, we obtain values whose ratio is equal to Pi , in accordance with the euclidean character of the geometry in the inertial reference system
now let the measurement be carried out with a yardstick at rest relative to k2
observing this process from the k1 system, we find that the yardstick laid along the circumference suffers a 'lorentz contraction, whereas the yardstick placed radially is not changed
it is therefore clear that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, obtained from such a measurement, will be greater than Pi 
in the general case of an arbitrary, varying gravitational field, the metric of space is not only non'euclidean, but also varies with the time
as a result, the relative position of test bodies introduced into the field, cannot remain unchanged in any coordinate system
thus if the particles are placed around the circumference of a circle and along a diameter, since the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is not equal to and changes with time, it is clear that if the separations of the particles along the diameter remain unchanged, the separations around the circumference must change, and conversely
thus in the general theory of relativity it is impossible in general, to have a system of bodies which are fixed relative to one another
this result essentially changes the very concept of a system of reference, in the general theory of relativity, as compared to its meaning in the special theory
in the latter we meant by a reference system a set of bodies at rest relative to one another
  in unchanging relative positions
such systems of bodies do not exist in the presence of a variable gravitational field, and for the exact determination of the position of a particle in space we must, strictly speaking, have an infinite number of bodies which fill all the space, like some sort of medium
such a system of bodies with arbitrarily running clocks fixed on them, constitutes a reference system in the general theory of relativity
in connection with the arbitrariness of the choice of a reference system, the laws of nature must be written in the general theory of relativity, in a form which is appropriate to any fourDimensional system of coordinates (or, as one says, in covariant form)
this, of course, does not imply the physical equivalence of all these reference systems (like the physical equivalence of all inertial reference systems in the special theory)
on the contrary, the specific appearances of physical phenomena, including the properties of the motion of bodies, become different in all systems of reference

if an observer is under the influence of electromagnetic forces, he can perform an experiment which makes him aware of the presence of the force, because bodies with different charges have different accelerations in the field, thus the observer can observe an acceleration for particles with charges less or greater than its own
but this is not true in the case of gravity, because gravitational charge is the mass itself
this is called equivalence of free fall and inertial motion, or equivalence of the mass (inertial mass) and gravitational charge (gravitational mass), or equivalence of gravitation and accelerated reference
in addition according to special relativity, energy is equivalent to (inertial) mass, so light have to lose energy when it rises in a gravitational field, since otherwise it can be turned into (inertial which then is equal to gravitational) mass, and through falling, gain an extra energy, leading to creation of energy from nothing
thus rising light is gravitationally redshifted, this shows that gravitation acts like local spacetime transformations, and it implies the curvature of spacetime
thus spacetime is not just a background for the motion of matter (massive bodies), but is itself influenced (curved) by it
for a spacetime with a local 'lorentz symmetry there is a maximum curvature which can be reached when a body's mass fits inside the so called 'schwarzschild radius (2*g*m/c^2), this is called a black hole
