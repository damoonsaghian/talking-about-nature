note that these are my personal understandings, and not necessarily correct;

strands don't have endings, thus there is actually only one ring tangled into itself;
strands don't have any restriction other than themselves;
  a strand is everywhere at all times, except where other strands restrict it;

note that strand restriction is a collective process;
this collective process can make a number of different rathional (ie unknotted) tangles;
tangles are not necessarily localized,
  they become localized when they interact with baths;

a photon is a twist on a strand; it moves (on average) at the speed of light;
massive elementary particles are tangles of two or three strands;
they move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light;

charged particles have chiral tangles;
chiral tangles can't restrict their cores completely, they have an unrestricted bump;
charged particles can change their (average) velocity by absorbing or emitting photons;

some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones;
mirror tangles neutralize each other's restrictions, and allow the cores to be untangled,
  which results in high frequency photons;

virtual particles are temporary tangles, ie tangles which annihilate after a short time;
note that virtual particles are completely destroyed (not decayed to to other particles),
  after a short time;

mass is the amount of inter_tangledness,
  and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle,
  as well as the amount of produced virtual gravitons;
