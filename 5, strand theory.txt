strands have no endings, thus there is actually only one ring tangled into itself;
strands have no restriction other than themselves;
  a strand is everywhere at all times, unless when other strands restrict it;
note that strand restriction is a collective process;
  ie it's determined by the whole structure of a strand configuration;

collective restrictions lead to a number of different rational (ie unknotted) tangles,
  called elementary tangles, which are made of 3 or less strands;

a photon is a twist on a strand; it moves (on average) at the speed of light;
the twist turns around the strand, and the frequency of this rotation is the photon's frequency;

massive elementary particles are tangles of two or three strands;
in free space they move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light;

charged particles have chiral tangles;
due to collective restrictions, chiral tangles can absorb or emit photons,
  and as a result change their (average) velocity;

note that when a photon is absorbed, its original strand will be unrestricted,
  and thus disappears into the border of space;
this is also what happens when emitting photons;
when a photon appears on a strand of a particle, and move away from it,
  the strand between the particle and the photon will be unrestricted;

some tangles are unstable and decay into stable ones;
mirror tangles neutralize each other's restrictions, and allow the cores to be untangled,
  which results in high frequency photons;

virtual particles are temporary tangles, ie tangles which annihilate after a short time;

mass is the amount of inter'tangledness, and thus it determines
  the inertial difficulty to move the tangle,
  as well as the amount of produced virtual gravitons;
