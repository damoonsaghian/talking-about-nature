note that these are my personal understandings, and not necessarily correct;

a photon is a twist on a strand; it moves (on average) at the speed of light;

massive elementary particles are tangles of two or three strands;
  they move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light;
charged particles can change their (average) velocity by absorbing or emitting photons;
note that tails are not restricted in their motion in any way;

tangles and photons are not necessarily localized,
  they become localized when they interact with baths;
some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones;
a tangle can be untangled with a mirror tangle, which results in high frequency photons;

virtual particles appear on tails of real particles;
so they are in some sense attached to their source, and are not independent like a real particle;

mass is the amount of inter_tangledness,
  and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle,
  as well as the amount of virtual gravitons sent on the tails;
