spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product;

vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts
  whose precise definitions can easily be found online;
a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is
  totally ordered, and has a complete metric;
  this means that the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers;

in a vector space with Minkowski inner product,
  all normal vectors (for which we have: v v = 1 or -1)
  are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:
    basis.i basis.j = g.i.j
    g.i.j = if i=j=1 then -1 elseif i=j then 1 else 0
vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:
  v.i = v basis.i
thus the inner product can be written as:
  v1 v2 = g.i.j v1.i v2.j
by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices;

transformations which leave the distance
  (ie (v2 - v1)^2\2 where "\" is rooting operation)
  invariant, are called symmetry transformations of spacetime;
they can be written as:
  v'.i = L.i.j v.j + v0.i
  g.i.j L.i.k L.j.l = g.k.l

symmetry transformations of spacetime, form a group called symmetry group of spacetime,
  which is a ten_parameter non-Abelian Lie group;
so the representations of Lorentz group can be studied using the corresponding Lie group;

= particles
point particles in a relativistic theory
  (in which instantaneous action at a distance isn't allowed),
  lead to infinite self-field (thus external finite fields can't accelerate the particle);
"self-force on a classical point charge, Robert M. Wald"
  "http://www.math.utk.edu/~fernando/barrett/bwald1.pdf"
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(physics)#Classical_physics_example"

in a relativistic theory only massless particles can be point-like;
particles which can change velocity, ie massive charged particles, must have a non-zero size;
note that this differs from the concept of a rigid body;
  in fact in a relativistic theory, rigid bodies don't exist;
the insides of particles must be considered special,
  in the sense that even spacetime cease to exist inside particles;
considering gravity (discussed below), we can say this size is the Schwarzschild radius;
furthermore, in general relativity, massive point particles (even with no charge) make no sense;

= fields
fields must transform according to a representation (or more generally a projective representation)
  of the spacetime symmetry group;
in other words fields must be a tensor or spinor on spacetime;
, scalar fields transform such that: f'(x') = f(x)
, vector fields: f'(x').i = L.i.j f(x).j
, higher order tensor fields:
  f'(x').i.j.… = L.i.k L.j.l … f(x).k.l.…
, spinor fields (note that values here are actually complex numbers):
  ψ'(x').i = S.i.j ψ(x).j
  γ.k.l.i S.i.j = S.l.i L.k.m γ.m.i.j
  γ.i.k.l γ.j.l.k + γ.i.k.l γ.i.l.k = 2 g.i.j

free fields are what we have when there is no interaction;
a free field is a superposition of plane waves;
plain-wave(x) = a0 cos(g.i.j p.i x.j + phase0)
  g.i.j p.i p.j >= 0 // ie positive energy
we define mass of a field as:
  m^2 = g.i.j p.i p.j

free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field;
free field equation (for any kind of field: scalar, tensor or spinor):
  g.i.j ∂∂f(x).i.j + m^2 f(x) = 0
absence of other derivative terms is because of positive energy constraint mentioned above;
  (Ostrogradsky instability)
for spinor fields the equation is simplified to:
  I γ.i.k.l ∂ψ(x).i.l - m ψ(x).k = 0
  where I^2 = -1

deviations from free motion, for a field,
  must always be accompanied by the deviation of another field from free motion;
  (kind of a generalized form of Newton's third law)
the exact mechanism of interaction (and thus the number of interacting fields)
  is determined by the gauge symmetry of interaction;
gauge (or local) symmetries are symmetries under spacetime dependent transformations;
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory"
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation
  (spacetime dependent phase transformation), by introducing one gauge field,
  to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term;
I γ.i ∂ψ(x).i - m ψ(x) = E gf(x).i γ.i ψ(x)
g.i.j ∂∂gf(x).i.j.k = E ~ψ(x).l γ.0 γ.k ψ(x).l
where "E" is the Euler's number, and "~" is complex conjugate operator;

= gravity
spacetime is a geometric space,
  ie it has geodesics, which determine the motion of free objects in it;
all free objects always move the same way, regardless of their mass and other properties;
on the other hand, according to the equivalence principle of gravity,
  objects near a massive (uncharged) body, move the same way,
  regardless of their mass and other properties;
so falling objects determine the geodesics;
this implies that in the presence of gravity, the geodesics are curved;

so instead of introducing a gravitational field,
  we can consider gravity as the curvature of spacetime itself;
note that gravity can be described as the curvature of space and time
  even in non_relativistic physics (Newton-Cartan theory);
though it's a bit uneasy and ugly, because there is two separate metrics;
"https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/revival-newton-cartan-theory/"

for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry, there is a maximum curvature which can be reached
  when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2*G*m/c^2);
  this is called a black hole;

i think dark energy is the result of activities at the border of space,
  so it's kind of a global feature of space,
  and can be interpreted as the cosmological constant;
although cosmological constant is the same throughout space,
  but during the growth of the universe, when its shape was different (eg during inflation),
  the cosmological constant could have different values;

= dark matter
there are discrepancies in a number of astrophysical observations:
, rotation velocities in galaxies doesn't decrease as distance from the center increases;
, gravitational lensing studies, need a lot more mass than can be seen;
, cosmic microwave background imprints, seems to show the existence of non-baryonic matter;
, gravitational lensing studies of the galaxy cluster collisions (such as Bullet Cluster)
  implies a component which does not follow baryonic matter;
currently these observations are best described using dark matter,
  a new kind of non-baryonic matter, which constitutes about 85% of all matter in the universe;

but i think it's possible to explain these discrepancies using entropic gravity;
instead of hordes of invisible particles, dark matter can be
  an interplay between ordinary matter and dark energy;
