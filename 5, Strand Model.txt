note that the explanation bellow is my personal thoughts,
  it completely differs from how Schiller presents his Strand Model;

vacuum is a web of straight strands;
it takes an average time equal to Planck time for strands to reach each other,
  and the average distance between strands is equal to Planck length;
thus on average a simple deformation on a strand (called a photon) moves with the speed of light;

tangled deformations (made of two or three strands)
  move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light;
  they can change their (average) velocity by emitting photons;
tangles are not necessarily between adjacent strands, they can be between distant strands;
tangles (as well as photons) are not necessarily localizable,
  they get localized when they interact with baths;

some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones;
a tangle can be untangled with a mirror tangle, which results in high frequency photons;
mass is the amount of inter_tangledness,
  and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle,
  as well as the curvature of nearby vacuum strands;
