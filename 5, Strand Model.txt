note that the following explanation is my personal thoughts;
it can be completely different from how Schiller presents his Strand Model;

vacuum is a web of straight strands;
it takes an average time equal to Planck time for strands to reach each other,
  and the average distance between strands is equal to Planck length;
thus on average a simple curve on a strand (called a photon),
  transmits to other strands at the speed of light;

tangles (made of three or more strands)
  transfer between strands  with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light;
  they can change their (average) velocity by emitting photons;
tangles (as well as photons) are not necessarily localized,
  they become localized when they interact with baths;
some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones;
a tangle can be untangled with a mirror tangle, which results in high frequency photons;
mass is the amount of inter_tangledness,
  and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle,
  as well as the curvature of nearby vacuum strands;
