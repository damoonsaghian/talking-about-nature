strand model http://motionmountain.com/research.html
(i think knots must be avoided, because to have knots made of one strand, and also to describe their motion, either we need the end of the strand, or we need the strand to be penetrable both lead to serious problems)
vacuum is a web of straight strands
any deformation in a strand transfers to the neighboring strands with the speed of light
it takes an average time equal to Planck time, and average distance of strands is equal to Planck length, the corresponding action is equal to Planck action, so the average speed of a simple curve on a strand (called a photon) is the speed of light
tangled deformations (made of two or three strands) move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light, they can change their (average) velocity by emitting photons
tangles are not necessarily between adjacent strands, they can be between distant strands, tangles (as well as photons) are not necessarily localizable, they get localized when they interact with baths
some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones
a tangle can be untangled with a mirror tangle and produce high frequency photons
mass is the amount of inter_tangledness, and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle, as well as the curvature of nearby vacuum strands

for lack of a better name, i call it the "tao", it flows through all things, inside and outside, and returns to the origin of all things (from "tao te ching")
