observations like the double_slit experiment, show that
  universe is made of discrete but extended entities called quanta;
quanta must be entirely and instantaneously created or destroyed in discrete units (like particles),
  even though each unit is generally infinitely extended (like a field);

fields can be considered as the probability amplitude for interaction of quanta;
  this make the measurement (which relies on interaction), a probabilistic process;
the fact that everything even measurement tools have field behaviors, implies that
  measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty;
  uncertainty principle is a property of fields:
  Δx Δk >= 1/2;
  Δt Δf >= 1/2;

= strong and weak interactions
strong and weak interactions (unlike electromagnetism) have very short ranges;
  thus in practice we always work with them in small scales,
  and with relatively small number of quanta;

strong interaction is described by a SU(3) gauge symmetry
  (3rd order special unitary group, the set of all 3 by 3 unitary matrices with unit determinant);
it implies 8 gauge quanta which even interact with each other,
  leading to confinement, and thus the short range of strong interaction;

weak interaction is described by a broken SU(2) gauge symmetry;
the symmetry must be broken, otherwise weak interaction would have long ranges;
to explain this symmetry breaking, we need another quanta called Higgs boson;
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory"

the apparent violation of mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries in weak interactions,
  is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles
  (not an asymmetry of spacetime itself);
in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles,
  seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries,
  because we are not considering the internal structure of particles;
  in other words, CPT symmetry is not violated;
an important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that
  quantons have some kind of internal structure;

any particle that is smaller than its own Compton wavelength must be elementary;
  (the Compton wavelength of a particle is equal to the wavelength of a photon
    whose energy is the same as the mass of that particle)
  if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it;
  this lighter particle would have a larger Compton wavelength than the composite particle;
  this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle
    must be larger than the Compton wavelength of its components;
however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact;
  as extended constituents have no localized mass;

in the strand theory, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands;
in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter, strands are;
if particles could really be elementary, it would be impossible to understand their properties;
in the strand model, particles are not really elementary,
  but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed;
  particles are tangles of unobservable strands
in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle,
  but gets rid of its limitations;
if one wants to think radically, the strand theory can be seen as,
  eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle;

a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century;
  any belt provides an example;
it is a famous exercise to show that:
  such a model is indeed invariant under 4π rotation, but not under 2π rotation;
  and that two such particles get entangled when exchanged, but get untangled when exchanged twice;
particles can have spin 1/2, provided that they have tails going to the border of space;
  if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work;
  spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension;

explaining black hole entropy seems to demand extended entities too;

extended entities can even explain the 3 dimensionality of space too;
  space is 3 dimensional because it's the only number of dimensions in which knots are possible;
Zeeman proved that (considering topological isotopes, or even piecewise linear isotopes)
  spheres can make knots only when the co_dimension is 2;
  (co_dimension is the difference between the dimension of the sphere and the container space)

there is another phenomena which i think is related to this:
  exotic smooth structures exist only on R^4;
  ie when "n" is not 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to R^n is diffeomorphic to R^n;
i think the origin of this phenomena is the failure of the Whitney trick,
  which i think is because of co_dimension 2,
  between 2_disks used in the Whitney trick, and the 4 dimensional space;
