vacuum is a web of straight strands. any deformation in a strand transfers to the neighboring strands with the speed of light.
it takes an average time equal to Planck time for strands to reach each other, and the average distance between strands is equal to Planck length. so on average a simple deformation on a strand (called a photon) moves with the speed of light. and on average any change is equal to Planck action.

tangled deformations (made of two or three strands) move with a constant velocity (on average) less than the speed of light. they can change their (average) velocity by emitting photons.
tangles are not necessarily between adjacent strands, they can be between distant strands. tangles (as well as photons) are not necessarily localizable, they get localized when they interact with baths.
some tangles are unstable and decay to stable ones.
a tangle can be untangled with a mirror tangle, and produce high frequency photons.
mass is the amount of inter_tangledness, and thus it determines the inertial difficulty to move the tangle, as well as the curvature of nearby vacuum strands.
