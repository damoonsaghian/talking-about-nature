spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product;

vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts
  whose precise definitions can easily be found online;
a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is
  totally ordered, and has a complete metric;
  this means that the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers;

in a vector space with Minkowski inner product,
  all normal vectors (for which we have: v^2 = ±1)
  are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:
    b.i b.j = g.ij
    where: g.ij = {
      -1, i=j=0
      1, i=j=1,2,3
      0, i!=j
    }
vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:
  v.i = v b.i
thus the inner product can be written as:
  v1 v2 = g.ij v1.i v2.j
by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices;
and for convenience we use this notation:
  v1.i v2.i' = g.ij v1.i v2.j

transformations which leave the distance (ie |v2 - v1|) invariant,
  are called symmetry transformations of spacetime;
they can be written as ("d.i" is an arbitrary displacement):
  v'.i = L.ij v.j + d.i
  where: L.ik L.i'l = g.kl

symmetry transformations of spacetime, form a group called spacetime symmetry group,
  which is a ten_parameter non_Abelian Lie group;
so the representations of spacetime symmetry group can be deduced
  using the representations of its corresponding Lie algebra,
  plus the projective representations (since it's not a simply connected group);

= why 3 dimensions for space?
this simple but usually overlooked question can actually be a guide to a unified theory,
  by implying extended entities;
3 is the only number of dimensions in which knots are possible;
Zeeman proved that (considering topological isotopes, or even piecewise linear isotopes)
  spheres can make knots only when the co_dimension is 2;
  (co_dimension is the difference between the dimension of the sphere and the container space)

there is another phenomena which i think is related to this:
  exotic smooth structures exist only on R^4;
ie when "n" is not 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to R^n is diffeomorphic to R^n;
i think the origin of this phenomena is the failure of the Whitney trick,
  which i think is because of co_dimension 2, between 2_disks used in Whitney trick, and the 4 dimensional space;

= particles
point particles in a relativistic theory
  (in which instantaneous action at a distance isn't allowed),
  lead to infinite self_field (thus external finite fields can't accelerate the particle);
"self_force on a classical point charge, Robert M. Wald"
  "http://www.math.utk.edu/~fernando/barrett/bwald1.pdf"
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(physics)#Classical_physics_example"

in a relativistic theory only massless particles can be point_like;
particles which can change velocity, ie massive charged particles, must have a non_zero size;
note that this differs from the concept of a rigid body;
  in fact in a relativistic theory, rigid bodies don't exist;
the insides of particles must be considered special,
  in the sense that even spacetime cease to exist inside particles;
considering gravity (discussed below), we can say this size is the Schwarzschild radius;
furthermore, in general relativity, massive point particles (even with no charge) make no sense;

= fields
fields must transform according to a representation of spacetime symmetry group;
in other words fields must be a tensor or spinor on spacetime;
, scalar fields transform such that: f'(x') = f(x)
, vector fields: f'.i(x') = L.ij f.j(x)
, higher order tensor fields: f'.ij…(x') = L.ik L.jl … f.kl…(x)
, spinor fields (note that the values here are actually complex numbers):
  ψ'.i(x') = S.ij ψ.j(x)
  where: γ.ijk S.kl = S.jk L.im γ.mkl
  where: γ.ijk γ.lkj + γ.ijk γ.ikj = 2 g.ij

free fields are what we have when there is no interaction;
a free field is a superposition of plane waves:
  f.i(x) = a.i E^(I k.j x.j')
  where "E" is the Euler's number and "I^2 = -1";
we define the mass of a field as: m^2 + k.i k.i' = 0

free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field;
free field equation for scalar fields:
  ∂∂f(x) + m^2 f(x) = 0
  where: ∂∂ = ∂.i ∂.i'
(note that all formulas are written in Planck units in which: c=G=ħ=k=1)
free field equation for tensor or spinor fields with spin "s":
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joos%E2%80%93Weinberg_equation"
for spin 1/2 it gives the Dirac's equation:
  I γ.ijk ∂.i' ψ.k(x) - m ψ.j(x) = 0

deviations from free motion, for a field,
  must always be accompanied by the deviation of another field from free motion;
  (kind of a generalized form of Newton's third law)
the exact mechanism of interaction (and thus the number of interacting fields)
  is determined by the gauge symmetry of interaction;
gauge (or local) symmetries are symmetries under spacetime dependent transformations;
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory"
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation
  (spacetime dependent phase transformation), by introducing a vector field,
  to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term;
I γ.ijk ∂.i' ψ.k(x) - m ψ.j(x) = E γ.ijk f.i'(x) ψ.k(x)
∂∂f.i(x) = E ψ~.k(x) γ.ikj ψ.j(x)
where "ψ~" is complex conjugate of "ψ";

= gravity
spacetime is a geometric space, ie it has geodesics, which determine the motion of free objects in it;
all free objects always move the same way, regardless of their mass and other properties;
on the other hand, according to the equivalence principle of gravity,
  objects near a massive (uncharged) body, move the same way,
  regardless of their mass and other properties;
so falling objects determine the geodesics;
this implies that in the presence of gravity, the geodesics are curved;

so instead of introducing a gravitational field,
  we can consider gravity as the curvature of spacetime itself;
note that gravity can be described as the curvature of space and time
  even in non_relativistic physics (NewtonCartan theory);
though it's a bit uneasy and ugly, because there is two separate metrics;
"https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/revival-newton-cartan-theory/"

for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry, there is a maximum curvature which can be reached
  when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2*G*m/c^2);
this is called a black hole;

i think dark energy is the result of activities at the border of space,
  so it's kind of a global feature of space,
  and can be interpreted as the cosmological constant;
although cosmological constant is the same throughout space,
  but during the growth of the universe, when its shape was different (eg during inflation),
  the cosmological constant could have different values;

= dark matter
there are discrepancies in a number of astrophysical observations:
, rotation velocities in galaxies doesn't decrease as distance from the center increases;
, gravitational lensing studies, need a lot more mass than can be seen;
, cosmic microwave background imprints, seems to show the existence of non_baryonic matter;
, gravitational lensing studies of the galaxy cluster collisions (such as Bullet Cluster)
  implies a component which does not follow baryonic matter;
currently these observations are best described using dark matter,
  a new kind of non_baryonic matter, which constitutes about 85% of all matter in the universe;

but i think it's possible to explain these discrepancies using entropic gravity;
instead of hordes of invisible particles, dark matter can be
  an interplay between ordinary matter and dark energy;
