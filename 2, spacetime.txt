spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product;

vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts
  whose precise definitions can easily be found online;
a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is
  totally ordered, and has a complete metric;
  this means that the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers;

in a vector space with Minkowski inner product,
  all normal vectors (for which we have: v v = 1 or -1)
  are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:
    basis.i basis.j = g.i.j;
    g.i.j = if i=j=1 {-1} else if i=j {1} else {0};
vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:
  v.i = v basis.i;
thus the inner product can be written as: v1 v2 = g.i.j v1.i v2.j;
by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices;

transformations which leave the distance
  (ie (v2 - v1)^2\2 where "\" is rooting operation)
  invariant, are called symmetry transformations of spacetime;
they can be written as:
  vt.i = L.i.j v.j + v0.i;
  g.i.j L.i.k L.j.l = g.k.l;

symmetry transformations of spacetime, form a group called symmetry group of spacetime,
  which is a ten_parameter non_abelian Lie group;
so the representations of Lorentz group can be studied using the corresponding Lie group;

non_relativistic physics (where instantanous action at a distace is possible),
  is a consistent theory;
Maxwell's equations which only deals with continuous currents,
  is a consistent theory too;
but point particles in a relativistic theory leads to infinite self_field
  (thus external finite fields can't accelerate the particle);
resolving these infinities needs renormalization, which is a phenomenological process,
  thus the resulting theory would not be fundamental;

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(physics)#Classical_physics_example"
furthermore general relativity (see next section) is not renormalizable;
so it's best to avoid point particles in relativistic theories altogether;
especially since nature shows us the right approach, as discussed in the next chapter;

= gravity
spacetime is a geometric space, ie it has geodesics,
  which determine the motion of free objects in it;
all free objects always move the same way, regardless of their mass;
according to the equivalence principle of gravity,
  motion of objects near a massive body, are the same, regardless of their mass;
so the paths taken by falling objects are the geodesics themselves;
  this means that in the presence of gravity, the geodesics are curved;

note that gravity can be described as the curvature of space even in classical physics;
describing gravity as an interaction (as is usually done in classical physics)
  is confusing;

for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry,
  there is a maximum curvature which can be reached
  when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2*G*m/c^2);
  this is called a black hole;

i think dark energy is the result of activities at the border of space,
  so it's kind of a global feature of space,
  and can be interpreted as the cosmological constant;
although cosmological constant is the same through out space,
  but during the growth of the universe, when its shape was different,
  the cosmological constant could have different values (eg during inflation);

= dark matter
there are discrepancies in a number of astrophysical observations:
, rotation velocities in galaxies doesn't decrease as distance from the center increases;
, gravitational lensing studies, need a lot more mass than can be seen;
, cosmic microwave background imprints, seems to show the existance of non_baryonic matter;
, gravitational lensing studies of the galaxy cluster collisions (such as Bullet Cluster)
  implies a component which does not follow baryonic matter;
currently these observations are best described using dark matter,
  a new kind non_baryonic matter,
  which constitutes about 85% of all matter in the universe;

but i think it's possible to explain these discrepancies using entropic gravity;
instead of hordes of invisible particles,
  dark matter can be an interplay between ordinary matter and dark energy;
