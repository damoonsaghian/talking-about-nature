= spacetime
spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product;
vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts
  whose precise definitions can be found easily in the Internet;
a real vector space is a vector space which
  its underlying field is totally ordered,
  and has a complete metric;
  this means that the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers;

in a vector space with Minkowski inner product,
  all normal vectors (for which we have: v v = 1 or -1)
  are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:
    basis.i basis.j = g.i.j;
    g.i.j = if i=j=0 {-1} else if i=j {1} else {0};
vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:
  v.i = v basis.i;
thus the inner product can be written as: v1 v2 = g.i.j v1.i v2.j;
by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices;

transformations which leave the distance
  (ie (v2 - v1)^2\2 where "\" is rooting operation)
  invariant, are called symmetry transformations;
  they can be written as:
    vt.i = L.i.j v.j + v0.i;
    g.i.j L.i.k L.j.l = g.k.l;

continuous symmetries are described by Lie groups;
  discrete symmetries are described by finite groups;

= fields
fields are functions on spacetime that
  transform linearly under symmetry transformations;
this means that they transform according to
  a linear representation of the spacetime symmetry group;

linear representations of a symmetry group determin
  the kind of objects, these groups linearly act on:
, scalar fields transform such that: ft(xt) = f(x);
, vector fields: ft(xt).i = L.i.j f(x).j;
, higher order tensor fields:
  ft(xt).i.j.… = L.i.k L.j.l … f(x).k.l.…;
, spinor fields (note that values here are actually complex numbers):
  ψt(xt).i = S.i.j ψ(x).j;
  γ.k.l.i S.i.j = S.l.i L.k.m γ.m.i.j;
  γ.i.k.l γ.j.l.k + γ.i.k.l γ.i.l.k = 2 g.i.j;
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#Clifford_algebras"

free fields are what we have when there is no interaction,
  like free particles which move with constant velocity;
a free field is a superposition of plane waves;
plain_wave(x) = a0 cos(g.i.j p.i x.j + phase0);
  g.i.j p.i p.j >= 0;
we define mass of a field as: m^2 = g.i.j p.i p.j;

free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field;
an example of a free field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, tensor or spinor)
  that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is:
  g.i.j ∂∂f(x).i.j + m^2 f(x) = 0;
in fact the most general form is:
  g.i.j ∂∂f(x).i.j - g.k.l g.i.j ∂∂∂∂f(x).k.l.i.j + … + (m^2 + m^4 + …) f(x) = 0;
  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations,
    is the result of inverse square law,
    which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space;)
  (Ostrogradsky instability)
for spinor fields the equation is simplified to:
  γ.i.k.l ∂ψ(x).i.l I - m ψ(x).k = 0;
    I^2 = -1;

deviations from free motion, for a field (or particle),
  must always be accompanied by
  the deviation of another field (or particle) from free motion;
  (kind of a generalized form of Newton's third law;)
the exact mechanism of interaction (and thus the number of interacting fields)
  is determined by the gauge symmetry of interaction;
gauge (or local) symmetries are symmetries under spacetime dependent transformations;
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory"
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation
  (spacetime dependent phase transformation),
  by introducing one gauge field,
  to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term:
γ.i ∂ψ(x).i I - m ψ(x) = E gf(x).i γ.i ψ(x);
g.i.j ∂∂gf(x).i.j.k = E ~ψ(x).l γ.0 γ.k ψ(x).l;
  where "~" is complex conjugate operator, and "E" is the Euler's number;

uncertainty principle is a property of fields:
  Δx Δk >= 1/2;
  Δt Δf >= 1/2;

= particles
see "Asim Barut, electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle";
interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy,
  which needs renormalization;

= gravity
spacetime is a geometric space, ie it has geodesics
  which determine the motion of free particles (and fields) in it;
all free particles always move the same way, regardless of their mass;

according to the equivalence principle of gravity,
  motion of particles near a massive body, are the same, regardless of their mass;
so the paths taken by falling bodies are the geodesics themselves;
  this means that in the presence of gravity, the geodesics are curved;
note that gravity can be described as the curvature of space even in classical physics;
  describing gravity as an interaction
  (as is usually done in classical physics) is confusing;

for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry,
  there is a maximum curvature which can be reached
  when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2*G*m/c^2);
  this is called a black hole;
primordial black holes are a good dark matter candidate;

i think dark energy is the result of activities at the border of space,
  so it's kind of a global feature of space,
  and can be interpreted as the cosmological constant;
although cosmological constant is the same through out space,
  but during the growth of the universe, when its shape was different,
  the cosmological constant could have different values (eg during inflation);
