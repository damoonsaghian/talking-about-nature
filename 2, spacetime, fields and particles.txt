= spacetime
spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product
vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts whose precise definitions can be find easily on the internet
a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is totally ordered, and has a complete metric, i'e the field is isomorphic to real numbers

in a vector space with Minkowski inner product, all normal vectors (i'e v*v = +-1) are divided into distinct groups (each called an basis), for which we have
  basis_i * basis_j = g_i_j
  g_i_j = if i==j==0 then -1 elseif i==j then 1 else 0
vector components with respect to a basis are defined by
  v_i = v * basis_i
thus the inner product can be written as: v1*v2 == g_i_j * v1_i * v2_j
(by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices)

transformations which leave the distance i'e \sqrt((v2-v1)^2) invariant, are called symmetry transformations, they can be written as
v'_i = Λ_i_j * v_j + Λ0_i
g_i_j * Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l = g_k_l

= fields
fields are functions on spacetime that transform linearly under symmetry transformations, this means that they transform according to a linear representation of the spacetime symmetry group
, scalar fields transform as: f'(x') = f(x)
, vector fields as: f'_i(x') = Λ_i_j * f_j(x)
, higher order tensor fields as
  f'_i_j_…(x') = Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l * … * f_k_l_…(x)
, spinor fields as
  ψ'_i(x') = S_i_j * ψ_j(x)
  γ_k_l_i * S_i_j = S_l_i * Λ_k_m * γ_m_i_j
  γ_i_k_l * γ_j_l_k + γ_i_k_l * γ_i_l_k = 2*g_i_j

free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field, i'e a superposition of plane waves (a free field is what we have when there is no interaction, like free particles which move with constant velocity)
  plain'wave(x) = a0 cos(g_i_j * p_i * x_j + phase0)
    where g_i_j * p_i * p_j >= 0
we define mass as: m^2 = g_i_j * p_i * p_j
an example of a free field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, tensor or spinor) that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) + m^2 * f(x) = 0
in fact the most general form is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) - g_k_l * g_i_j * d_k d_l d_i d_j f(x) + ... +
    (m^2 + m^4 + ...)*f(x) = 0
  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations, is the result of inverse square law, which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space)
  (Ostrogradsky instability)
for spinor fields the equation is simplified to
  γ_i_k_l * d_i ψ_l(x) *I - m * ψ_k(x) = 0
  (I^2 = -1)

field equations have symmetry transformations that are not related to spacetime, for example multiplying the field by a constant number leaves the equation invariant, although this is a trivial property due to the equation being linear, it is a guide to nontrivial symmetries
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation (spacetime dependent phase transformation) by introducing a gauge field, to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term
γ_i * d_i ψ(x) *I - m * ψ(x) = E * gf_i(x) * γ_i * ψ(x)
g_i_j * d_i d_j gf_k(x) = E * ψ(x)† * γ_0 * γ_k * ψ(x)
  († is conjugate transpose operator)
these equations describe how fields can interact with each other

uncertainty principle is a property of fields
Δx * Δk >= 1/2
Δt * Δf >= 1/2

= particles
see "Asim Barut, electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle"

interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy for point particles which needs renormalization

= gravity
spacetime is a geometric space, i'e it has geodesics which determine the motion of free particles (and fields) in it
free particles always move the same way, regardless of their mass

according to the equivalence principle of garvity, motion of particles (and fields) near a massive body, are the same, regardless of their mass
so the paths taken by falling bodies are the geodesics themselves
this means that in the presence of gravity, the geodesics are curved

for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry, there is a maximum curvature which can be reached when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2*g*m/c^2), this is called a black hole

i think dark energy is the result of activities at the border of space, so it's kind of a global feature of space, and can be interpreted as the cosmological constant
although cosmological constant is constant through space, but during the growth of the universe, when it's shape was different, the cosmological constant could had different values (e'g during inflation)

primordial black holes are a good dark matter candidate
