= spacetime
spacetime is a 4 dimensional real vector space with an inner product (with 'lorentzian signature)
real vector space is a vector space on a field which is totally ordered, and has a complete metric, i'e the field is isomorphic to real numbers
inner product is a map which to every two vectors, associates a scalar, and it is
, symmetric: v1*v2 == v2*v1
, linear in addition: (v1 + v2)*v3 == v1*v2 + v2*v3
  and linear in multiplication ("a" is a scalar): (a*v1)*v2 == a*(v1*v2)
, non'degenerate: if v1*v2 == 0 then v1 == 0 or v2 == 0
(note that this is what usually called pseudo inner product in the literature, because it's allowed to have an indefinite signature, as opposed to a positive'definite one)

in an inner product space, a set of mutually orthonormal vectors are defined by
  ev_i * ev_j = g_i_j
  g_i_j = if i == j then +-1 else 0
for spacetime we have 'lorentzian signature
  g_i_j = if i==j==0 then 1 elseif i==j==1..3 then -1 else 0
those sets of orthonormal vectors that have the maximum possible number of elements, are called orthonormal bases of the inner product space, and that maximum number is called the dimension of the inner product space
  (orthonormal basis is qauranteed to exist for complete inner product spaces)
vector components with respect to an orthonormal basis are defined by: v_i = v * ev_i
thus the inner product can be written as: v1*v2 == g_i_j * v1_i * v2_j
  (by convention repeated indices in a product means summing over those indices)

transformations which leave the distance i'e \sqrt((v2-v1)^2) invariant, are called symmetry transformations, they can be written as
v'_i = st_i_j * v_j + st0_i
g_i_j * st_i_k * st_j_l = g_k_l

= fields
fields are functions on spacetime that transform linearly under symmetry transformation, this implies that they transform according to a representation of the spacetime symmetry group
, scalar fields transform as: f'(x') = f(x)
, vector fields as: f'_i(x') = st_i_j * f_j(x)
, higher order tensor fields as
  f'_i_j_...(x') = st_i_k * st_j_l * ... * f_k_l_...(x)
, spinor (dirac) fields as
  sf'_i(x') = spin_i_j * sf_j(x)
  \gamma_k_l_i * spin_i_j = spin_l_i * st_k_m * \gamma_m_i_j
  \gamma_i_k_l * \gamma_j_l_k + \gamma_i_k_l * \gamma_i_l_k = 2*g_i_j

linear field equation is an equation which its solutions are free fields, i'e a superposition of plane waves (free fields are what we have when there is no interaction, like free particles which move with constant velocity)
  free'field(x) = \sum(p, \alpha_p * e^(im * g_i_j * p_i * x_j))
  g_i_j * p_i * p_j = m^2
an example of a linear field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, vector or spinor) that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) + m^2 * f(x) = 0
in fact the most general form for a general vector space is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) - g_k_l * g_i_j * d_k d_l d_i d_j f(x) + ... +
    (m^2 + m^4 + ...)*f(x) = 0
  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations, is the result of inverse square law, which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space)
  ('ostrogradsky instability)
for spinor fields the equation is simplified to
  im * \gamma_i_k_l * d_i sf_l(x) - m * sf_k(x) = 0

field equations have symmetry transformations that are not related to spacetime
for example multiplying the field by a constant number leaves the equation invariant
although this is a trivial property due to the equation being linear, it is a guide to nontrivial symmetries
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation (spacetime dependent phase transformation) by introducing a gauge field, to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term
im * \gamma_i * d_i sf(x) - m * sf(x) = e * gf_i(x) * \gamma_i * sf(x)
g_i_j * d_i d_j gf_k(x) = e * ctr(sf(x)) * \gamma_0 * \gamma_k * sf(x)
("ctr" means conjugate transpose)
these equations describe how fields can interact with each other

uncertainty principle is a property of fields
\delta x * \delta k >= 1/2
\delta t * \delta f >= 1/2

= classical physics is inconsistent
see "'asim 'barut, electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle"
the discussion about self energy of point particles at the end of this book is briefly presented below, but the discussion seems unnecessary if we see classical theory of particles and fields, only as an approximation (which can be even inconsistent) of quantum theory (which is consistent and renormalizable, neglecting gravity of course)

interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy for point particles which its renormalization leads to non causal effects
each electron is located in a place where there is an infinite force of repulsion against electrons
we might simply declare that although the force of repulsion on a charged particle from its own field is infinite, it is equally infinite in all directions, so the infinite forces cancel out, leaving no net force on the particle due to its own field, at least if the particle is in uniform motion
then we can further suppose that the acceleration of a charged particle causes it to bias this singularity as it overtakes its own field, thereby incurring a net force (which can be made finite by mass renormalization), this same disturbance of the field results in radiation, so we can see the expected correlation between radiation and reaction
however, this approach leads to some highly nonIntuitive conclusions. for one thing, the equation of motion based on this premise seems to imply that, a uniformly accelerating charge does not radiate at all, even more disquieting, we find that the equations of motion for a free charged particle, possess run-away solutions, in which the particle rapidly accelerates toward the speed of light, in effect the particle is surfing on its own field
there is another way to get rid of infinite self'energy, but it leads to non'causal effects
we could point out that an electron does not interact with its own field, it interacts only with the fields of other particles
if we take this approach we must then explain why a charged particle resists changes in its state of motion, more strongly than an uncharged particle of the same inertial mass, the traditional account of accelerated charges tell us that this radiation reaction force applied through the particle's motion supplies the energy that is radiated away in the form of electromagnetic waves
the origin of this force is usually taken to be the interaction of the particle with its own field, thus if we declare that charged particles do not interact with their own fields, we need a different explanation for radiation reaction
one wellKnown candidate is the 'wheeler'feynman absorber theory, according to which the excess resistance of a charged particle, to changes in its state of motion is due to advanced waves emanating backwards in time, from an all encompassing array of absorbers in the future, whose waves are excited by the retarded waves emanating forwards in time from the particle
note that a field is necessarily both absorbed and emitted, if it were not, we would have no experience of it, it is only the emission and absorption events that are observable, not the existence of some entity in transit
