= spacetime
spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product.
vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts whose precise definitions can be found easily on the internet.
a real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is totally ordered, and has a complete metric. that is, the underlying field is isomorphic to real numbers.

in a vector space with Minkowski inner product, all normal vectors (for which we have: v v = +-1) are divided into distinct groups, each called a basis, for which we have:
  basis_i basis_j = g_i_j
  g_i_j = if i=j=0 then -1 elseif i=j then 1 else 0
vector components with respect to a basis are defined by:
  v_i = v basis_i.
thus the inner product can be written as: v1 v2 = g_i_j v1_i v2_j
(by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices.)
(also note that in math formulas, space between names means different things in different situations:
  space between to vectors means inner product.
  if there is a scalar, it means scalar multiplication.
  if the name at the left side is a function, it means function application.)

transformations which leave the distance, i'e \sqrt((v2-v1)^2), invariant, are called symmetry transformations, they can be written as:
  v'_i = Λ_i_j v_j + v0_i
  g_i_j Λ_i_k Λ_j_l = g_k_l

= fields
fields are functions on spacetime that transform linearly under symmetry transformations. this means that they transform according to a linear representation of the spacetime symmetry group.
, scalar fields transform as: f'(x') = f(x)
, vector fields as: f'_i(x') = Λ_i_j f_j(x)
, higher order tensor fields as:
  f'_i_j_…(x') = Λ_i_k Λ_j_l … f_k_l_…(x)
, spinor fields as:
  ψ'_i(x') = S_i_j ψ_j(x)
  γ_k_l_i S_i_j = S_l_i Λ_k_m γ_m_i_j
  γ_i_k_l γ_j_l_k + γ_i_k_l γ_i_l_k = 2g_i_j

free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field, i'e a superposition of plane waves. (a free field is what we have when there is no interaction, like free particles which move with constant velocity)
plain'wave(x) = a0 cos(g_i_j p_i x_j + phase0)
  where g_i_j p_i p_j >= 0
we define mass as: m^2 = g_i_j p_i p_j
an example of a free field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, tensor or spinor) that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is:
  g_i_j (d_i d_j f)x + m^2 * f(x) = 0
in fact the most general form is:
  g_i_j (d_i d_j f)x - g_k_l g_i_j (d_k d_l d_i d_j f)x + ... +
    (m^2 + m^4 + ...) f(x) = 0
  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations, is the result of inverse square law, which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space.)
  (Ostrogradsky instability)
for spinor fields the equation is simplified to:
  γ_i_k_l (d_i ψ_l)x I - m ψ_k(x) = 0
  (I^2 = -1)

deviation from free motion, for a field (or particle), must always be done via the deviation of another field (or particle) from free motion. (kind of a generalized form of Newton's third law)
the exact mechanism of interaction (and thus the number of interacting fields) is determined by the gauge symmetry of interaction.
gauge (or local) symmetries are symmetries under spacetime dependent transformations.
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation (spacetime dependent phase transformation), by introducing one gauge field, to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term.
γ_i (d_i ψ)x I - m ψ(x) = E gf_i(x) γ_i ψ(x)
g_i_j (d_i d_j gf_k)x = E ψ(x)† γ_0 γ_k ψ(x)
  († is conjugate transpose operator, E is the Euler's number.)

uncertainty principle is a property of fields:
  Δx Δk >= 1/2
  Δt Δf >= 1/2

= particles
see "Asim Barut, electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle".

interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy for point particles, which needs renormalization.

= gravity
spacetime is a geometric space, i'e it has geodesics which determine the motion of free particles (and fields) in it.
free particles always move the same way, regardless of their mass.

according to the equivalence principle of gravity, motion of particles (and fields) near a massive body, are the same, regardless of their mass.
so the paths taken by falling bodies are the geodesics themselves. this means that in the presence of gravity, the geodesics are curved.

for a spacetime with a local Lorentz symmetry, there is a maximum curvature which can be reached when a body's mass fits inside the so called Schwarzschild radius (2 g m / c^2), this is called a black hole.

i think dark energy is the result of activities at the border of space, so it's kind of a global feature of space, and can be interpreted as the cosmological constant.
although cosmological constant is the same through out space, but during the growth of the universe, when it's shape was different, the cosmological constant could have different values (e'g during inflation).

primordial black holes are a good dark matter candidate.
