= spacetime
spacetime is a real vector space with a Minkowski inner product
vector space and inner product are mathematical concepts whose precise definitions can be find easily on the internet
real vector space is a vector space which its underlying field is totally ordered, and has a complete metric, i'e the field is isomorphic to real numbers

in a vector space with Minkowski inner product, all normal vectors (i'e v*v = +-1) are divided into distinct groups (each called an orthonoramal basis), for which
  o'b_i * o'b_j = g_i_j
  g_i_j = if i==j==0 then -1 elseif i==j then 1 else 0
vector components with respect to an orthonormal basis (o'b) are defined by
  v_i = v * o'b_i
thus the inner product can be written as: v1*v2 == g_i_j * v1_i * v2_j
(by convention repeated indices in a multiplication means summing over those indices)

transformations which leave the distance i'e \sqrt((v2-v1)^2) invariant, are called symmetry transformations, they can be written as
v'_i = Λ_i_j * v_j + Λ0_i
g_i_j * Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l = g_k_l

= fields
fields are functions on spacetime that transform linearly under symmetry transformations, this means that they transform according to a linear representation of the spacetime symmetry group
, scalar fields transform as: f'(x') = f(x)
, vector fields as: f'_i(x') = Λ_i_j * f_j(x)
, higher order tensor fields as
  f'_i_j_…(x') = Λ_i_k * Λ_j_l * … * f_k_l_…(x)
, spinor fields as
  ψ'_i(x') = S_i_j * ψ_j(x)
  γ_k_l_i * S_i_j = S_l_i * Λ_k_m * γ_m_i_j
  γ_i_k_l * γ_j_l_k + γ_i_k_l * γ_i_l_k = 2*g_i_j

free field equation is an equation which every solution of it is a free field, i'e a superposition of plane waves (a free field is what we have when there is no interaction, like free particles which move with constant velocity)
  plain'wave(x) = a0 cos(g_i_j * p_i * x_j + ph0)
  where g_i_j * p_i * p_j >= 0
we define mass as: m^2 = g_i_j * p_i * p_j
an example of a free field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, tensor or spinor) that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) + m^2 * f(x) = 0
in fact the most general form for is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) - g_k_l * g_i_j * d_k d_l d_i d_j f(x) + ... +
    (m^2 + m^4 + ...)*f(x) = 0
  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations, is the result of inverse square law, which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space)
  (Ostrogradsky instability)
for spinor fields the equation is simplified to (I^2 = -1)
  γ_i_k_l * d_i ψ_l(x) *I - m * ψ_k(x) = 0

field equations have symmetry transformations that are not related to spacetime, for example multiplying the field by a constant number leaves the equation invariant, although this is a trivial property due to the equation being linear, it is a guide to nontrivial symmetries
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation (spacetime dependent phase transformation) by introducing a gauge field, to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term
γ_i * d_i ψ(x) *I -m * ψ(x) = E * gf_i(x) * γ_i * ψ(x)
g_i_j * d_i d_j gf_k(x) = E * ψ(x)† * γ_0 * γ_k * ψ(x)
  († is conjugate transpose operator)
these equations describe how fields can interact with each other

uncertainty principle is a property of fields
Δx * Δk >= 1/2
Δt * Δf >= 1/2

= classical physics is inconsistent
see "Asim Barut, electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle"
the discussion about self energy of point particles at the end of this book is briefly presented below, but the discussion seems unnecessary if we see classical theory of particles and fields, only as an approximation (which can be even inconsistent) of quantum theory (which is consistent and renormalizable, neglecting gravity of course)

interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy for point particles which its renormalization leads to non causal effects
each electron is located in a place where there is an infinite force of repulsion against electrons
we might simply declare that although the force of repulsion on a charged particle from its own field is infinite, it is equally infinite in all directions, so the infinite forces cancel out, leaving no net force on the particle due to its own field, at least if the particle is in uniform motion
then we can further suppose that the acceleration of a charged particle causes it to bias this singularity as it overtakes its own field, thereby incurring a net force (which can be made finite by mass renormalization), this same disturbance of the field results in radiation, so we can see the expected correlation between radiation and reaction
however, this approach leads to some highly nonIntuitive conclusions. for one thing, the equation of motion based on this premise seems to imply that, a uniformly accelerating charge does not radiate at all, even more disquieting, we find that the equations of motion for a free charged particle, possess run-away solutions, in which the particle rapidly accelerates toward the speed of light, in effect the particle is surfing on its own field
there is another way to get rid of infinite self'energy, but it leads to non'causal effects
we could point out that an electron does not interact with its own field, it interacts only with the fields of other particles
if we take this approach we must then explain why a charged particle resists changes in its state of motion, more strongly than an uncharged particle of the same inertial mass, the traditional account of accelerated charges tell us that this radiation reaction force applied through the particle's motion supplies the energy that is radiated away in the form of electromagnetic waves
the origin of this force is usually taken to be the interaction of the particle with its own field, thus if we declare that charged particles do not interact with their own fields, we need a different explanation for radiation reaction
one wellKnown candidate is the Wheeler'Feynman absorber theory, according to which the excess resistance of a charged particle, to changes in its state of motion is due to advanced waves emanating backwards in time, from an all encompassing array of absorbers in the future, whose waves are excited by the retarded waves emanating forwards in time from the particle
note that a field is necessarily both absorbed and emitted, if it were not, we would have no experience of it, it is only the emission and absorption events that are observable, not the existence of some entity in transit
