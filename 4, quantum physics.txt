= quantum fields
let us imagine a screen impermeable to electrons, in which two slits are cut
on observing the passage of a beam of electrons through one of the slits (the other being covered) we obtain, on a continuous screen placed behind the slit, some pattern of intensity distribution
on observing the passage of the beam through both slits, we should expect, on the basis of ordinary classical ideas, a pattern which is a simple superposition of the other two, each electron, moving in its path, passes through one of the slits, and has no effect on the electrons passing through the other slit
however, in reality we obtain a diffraction pattern  which, owing to interference, does not at all correspond to the sum of the patterns given by each slit separately
it is clear that this result can in no way be reconciled with the idea that electrons move in paths
experiments like this show that universe is made of discrete but extended entities called quantum fields
quantum fields must be entirely and instantaneously created or destroyed in discrete units (like particles), even though each unit is generally infinitely extended (unlike a particle)
changes in the field are quantized (not continuous)

while the motion of quantum fields in spacetime can be described by a field equation, quantum fields always interacts in discrete units
thus a field (such as the dirac field) can be considered as the probability amplitude for interaction with another field (such as the electromagnetic field)
thus the field particle duality makes the measurement (which relies on interactions), a probabilistic process
by a quantum measurement, we mean any process in which a quantum phenomenon causes a macroscopic change
the fact that everything even measurement tools have field behaviours, implies that measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty (because of the field's uncertainty mentioned earlier)
the discrete entities of a quantum field have no independent dynamical characteristic
dynamical characteristics of the electron appear only as a result of the measurement itself
thus the measurement process always affects the quantum field subjected to it, and it is in principle impossible to make its effect arbitrarily small (for a given accuracy of measurement) the more exact the measurement, the stronger the effect exerted by it (because it demands stronger interaction) and only in measurements of very low accuracy, can the effect on the measured object be small

= strong and weak interactions
in quantum chromodynamics (which describes strong forces) a generalization of the dirac equation is used that have s'u3 internal symmetry (3rd order special unitary group, the set of all 3*3 unitary matrices with unit determinant) instead of the trivial u1 internal symmetry
this equation implies the interaction between gauge fields themselves
but since in this approach, there is no rigorous explanation (yet) for confinement, i think it is better to describe strong force as a binding process, due to the internal structures of quantons, not as an interaction like electromagnetism

also i think weak bosons are not new elementary particles, they are just an (extremely short lived) entanglement of other particles
, w- is an entanglement of an electron and an anti'neutrino (or higher generations)
, w+ is an anti'electron and a neutrino (or higher generations)
, and z is a particle and its antiparticle
weak interaction is nothing but the decay of unstable quantons to stable ones
and since particle decays are not motions in spacetime, there is no violation of mirror inversion or time reversal symmetries
the apparent asymmetry is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles, in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries
this description is equivalent to conventional one as the broken s'u2 local gauge interaction, with elementary weak bosons, but as we will see in the chapter on strand model it helps us to avoid single stranded knots
an important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that quantons have some kind of internal structure

= hints to extended entities
any particle that is smaller than its own compton wavelength must be elementary
if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it, this lighter particle would have a larger compton wavelength than the composite particle, this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle must be larger than the compton wavelength of its components
however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact
the difficulties of compact constituents were described by 'andrei 'sakharov in the 1960s
if the constituents are extended, the previous argument does not apply, as extended constituents have no localized mass
as a result, if a flying arrow ('zeno's famous example) is made of extended constituents, it cannot be said to be at a given position at a given time
  shortening the observation time towards the Planck time, makes an arrow disappear in the cloud that makes up spacetime

in the strand model, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands
in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter, strands are
if particles could really be elementary, it would be impossible to understand their properties
in the strand model, particles are not really elementary, but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed, particles are tangles of unobservable strands
in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle, but gets rid of its limitations
if one wants to think radically, the strand model can be seen as, eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle

a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century, any belt provides an example, any localized structure with any number of tails attached to it (tails that reach the border of the region of space under consideration) has the same properties as a spin 1/2 particle, the only condition is that the tails themselves are unobservable
the tail model even has the same problems with highly curved space, as real spin 1/2 particles have
it is a famous exercise to show that such a model is indeed invariant under 4 'pi rotations, but not under 2 'pi rotations, and that two such particles get entangled when exchanged, but get untangled when exchanged twice, the tail model thus confirms that rotation is partial exchange
particles can have spin 1/2 provided that they have tails going to the border of space, if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work
spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension
