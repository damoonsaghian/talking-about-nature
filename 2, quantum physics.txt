= spacetime
spacetime is a 4 dimensional real vector space with an inner product (with 'lorentzian signature)
real vector space is a vector space on a field which is totally ordered, and has a complete metric, i'e the field is isomorphic to real numbers
inner product is a map which to every two vectors, associates a scalar, and it is
, symmetric: v1*v2 == v2*v1
, linear in addition: (v1 + v2)*v3 == v1*v2 + v2*v3
  and linear in multiplication ("a" is a scalar): (a*v1)*v2 == a*(v1*v2)
, non'degenerate: if v1*v2 == 0 then v1 == 0 or v2 == 0
(note that this is what usually called pseudo inner product in the literature, because it doesn't have the positive'definite condition)

in an inner product space, a set of mutually orthonormal vectors are defined by
  ev_i * ev_j = g_i_j
  g_i_j = if i == j then +-1 else 0
for spacetime we have 'lorentzian signature
  g_i_j = if i==j==0 then 1 elseif i==j==1..3 then -1 else 0
those sets of orthonormal vectors that have the maximum possible number of elements, are called orthonormal bases of the inner product space, and that maximum number is called the dimension of the inner product space
  (orthonormal basis is qauranteed to exist for complete inner product spaces)
vector components with respect to an orthonormal basis are defined by: v_i = v * ev_i
thus the inner product can be written as: v1*v2 == g_i_j * v1_i * v2_j
  (by convention repeated indices in a product means summing over those indices)

transformations which leave the distance i'e \sqrt((v2-v1)^2) invariant, are called symmetry transformations, they can be written as
v'_i = st_i_j * v_j + st0_i
g_i_j * st_i_k * st_j_l = g_k_l

= fields
fields are functions on spacetime that transform linearly under symmetry transformation, this implies that they transform according to a representation of the spacetime symmetry group
, scalar fields transform as: f'(x') = f(x)
, vector fields as: f'_i(x') = st_i_j * f_j(x)
, higher order tensor fields as
  f'_i_j...(x') = st_i_k * st_j_l * ... * f_k_l...(x)
, spinor (dirac) fields as
  sf'_i(x') = spin_i_j * sf_j(x)
  \gamma_k_l_i * spin_i_j = spin_l_i * st_k_m * \gamma_m_i_j
  \gamma_i_k_l * \gamma_j_l_k + \gamma_i_k_l * \gamma_i_l_k = 2*g_i_j

linear field equation is an equation which its solutions are free fields, i'e a superposition of plane waves (free fields are what we have when there is no interaction, like free particles which move with constant velocity)
  free'field(x) = \sum(p, \alpha_p * e^(im * g_i_j * p_i * x_j))
  g_i_j * p_i * p_j = m^2
an example of a linear field equation (for any kind of field, scalar, vector or spinor) that is invariant under spacetime symmetry transformations is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) + m^2 * f(x) = 0
in fact the most general form for a general vector space is
  g_i_j * d_i d_j f(x) - g_k_l * g_i_j * d_k d_l d_i d_j f(x) + ... +
    (m^2 + m^4 + ...)*f(x) = 0
  (i think the absence of higher derivative terms in spacetime field equations, is the result of inverse square law, which itself is related to 3 dimensionality of space)
  ('ostrogradsky instability)
for spinor fields the equation is simplified to
  im * \gamma_i_k_l * d_i sf_l(x) - m * sf_k(x) = 0

field equations have symmetry transformations that are not related to spacetime
for example multiplying the field by a constant number leaves the equation invariant
although this is a trivial property due to the equation being linear, it is a guide to nontrivial symmetries
we can write a field equation that is invariant under a local phase transformation (spacetime dependent phase transformation) by introducing a gauge field, to compensate for the variations due to the derivative term
im * \gamma_i * d_i sf - m * sf = e * gf_i * \gamma_i * sf
g_i_j * d_i d_j gf_k = e * ctr(sf) * \gamma_0 * \gamma_k * sf
("ctr" means conjugate transpose)
these equations describe how fields can interact with each other

uncertainty principle is a property of fields
\delta x * \delta k >= 1/2
\delta t * \delta f >= 1/2

= quantum fields
let us imagine a screen impermeable to electrons, in which two slits are cut
on observing the passage of a beam of electrons through one of the slits (the other being covered) we obtain, on a continuous screen placed behind the slit, some pattern of intensity distribution
on observing the passage of the beam through both slits, we should expect, on the basis of ordinary classical ideas, a pattern which is a simple superposition of the other two, each electron, moving in its path, passes through one of the slits, and has no effect on the electrons passing through the other slit
however, in reality we obtain a diffraction pattern  which, owing to interference, does not at all correspond to the sum of the patterns given by each slit separately
it is clear that this result can in no way be reconciled with the idea that electrons move in paths
experiments like this show that universe is made of discrete but extended entities called quantum fields
quantum fields must be entirely and instantaneously created or destroyed in discrete units (like particles), even though each unit is generally infinitely extended (unlike a particle)

while the motion of quantum fields in spacetime can be described by a field equation, quantum fields always interacts in discrete units
thus a field (such as the dirac field) can be considered as the probability amplitude for interaction with another field (such as the electromagnetic field)
thus the field particle duality makes the measurement (which relies on interactions), a probabilistic process
the fact that everything even measurement tools have field behaviours, implies that measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty (because of the field's uncertainty mentioned above)
the discrete entities of a quantum field have no independent dynamical characteristic
dynamical characteristics of the electron appear only as a result of the measurement itself
thus the measurement process always affects the quantum field subjected to it, and it is in principle impossible to make its effect arbitrarily small (for a given accuracy of measurement) the more exact the measurement, the stronger the effect exerted by it (because it demands stronger interaction) and only in measurements of very low accuracy, can the effect on the measured object be small

= strong and weak interactions
in quantum chromodynamics (which describes strong forces) a generalization of the dirac equation is used that have s'u3 internal symmetry (3rd order special unitary group, the set of all 3*3 unitary matrices with unit determinant) instead of the trivial u1 internal symmetry
this equation implies the interaction between gauge fields themselves
but since in this approach, there is no rigorous explanation (yet) for confinement, i think it is better to describe strong force as a binding process, due to the internal structures of quantons, not as an interaction like electromagnetism

also i think weak bosons are not new elementary particles, they are just an (extremely short lived) entanglement of other particles
, w- is an entanglement of an electron and an anti'neutrino (or higher generations)
, w+ is an anti'electron and a neutrino (or higher generations)
, and z is a particle and its antiparticle
weak interaction is nothing but the decay of unstable quantons to stable ones
and since particle decays are not motions in spacetime, there is no violation of mirror inversion or time reversal symmetries
the apparent asymmetry is due to the asymmetry in the internal structure of particles, in other words processes that change the internal structure of particles seem to violate  mirror inversion and time reversal symmetries
this description is equivalent to conventional one as the broken s'u2 local gauge interaction, with elementary weak bosons, but as we will see in the chapter on strand model it helps us to avoid single stranded knots
an important point here is that the decay of quantons actually shows us that quantons have some kind of internal structure

= classical physics is inconsistent
it is interesting to see how quantum fields lead to classical particles and fields
  as approximations
'asim 'barut "electrodynamics and classical theory of fields and particle"
the discussion about self energy of point particles at the end of this book is briefly presented below, but the discussion seems unnecessary if we see classical theory of particles and fields, only as an approximation (which can be even inconsistent) of quantum theory (which is consistent and renormalizable, neglecting gravity of course)

interactions of fields and particles, leads to infinite self energy for point particles which its renormalization leads to non causal effects
each electron is located in a place where there is an infinite force of repulsion against electrons
we might simply declare that although the force of repulsion on a charged particle from its own field is infinite, it is equally infinite in all directions, so the infinite forces cancel out, leaving no net force on the particle due to its own field, at least if the particle is in uniform motion
then we can further suppose that the acceleration of a charged particle causes it to bias this singularity as it overtakes its own field, thereby incurring a net force (which can be made finite by mass renormalization), this same disturbance of the field results in radiation, so we can see the expected correlation between radiation and reaction
however, this approach leads to some highly nonIntuitive conclusions. for one thing, the equation of motion based on this premise seems to imply that, a uniformly accelerating charge does not radiate at all, even more disquieting, we find that the equations of motion for a free charged particle, possess run-away solutions, in which the particle rapidly accelerates toward the speed of light, in effect the particle is surfing on its own field
there is another way to get rid of infinite self'energy, but it leads to non'causal effects
we could point out that an electron does not interact with its own field, it interacts only with the fields of other particles
if we take this approach we must then explain why a charged particle resists changes in its state of motion, more strongly than an uncharged particle of the same inertial mass, the traditional account of accelerated charges tell us that this radiation reaction force applied through the particle's motion supplies the energy that is radiated away in the form of electromagnetic waves
the origin of this force is usually taken to be the interaction of the particle with its own field, thus if we declare that charged particles do not interact with their own fields, we need a different explanation for radiation reaction
one wellKnown candidate is the 'wheeler'feynman absorber theory, according to which the excess resistance of a charged particle, to changes in its state of motion is due to advanced waves emanating backwards in time, from an all encompassing array of absorbers in the future, whose waves are excited by the retarded waves emanating forwards in time from the particle
note that a field is necessarily both absorbed and emitted, if it were not, we would have no experience of it, it is only the emission and absorption events that are observable, not the existence of some entity in transit

= hints to extended entities
any particle that is smaller than its own compton wavelength must be elementary
if it were composite, there would be a lighter component inside it, this lighter particle would have a larger compton wavelength than the composite particle, this is impossible, since the size of a composite particle must be larger than the compton wavelength of its components
however, an elementary particle can have constituents, provided that they are not compact
the difficulties of compact constituents were described by 'andrei 'sakharov in the 1960s
if the constituents are extended, the previous argument does not apply, as extended constituents have no localized mass
as a result, if a flying arrow ('zeno's famous example) is made of extended constituents, it cannot be said to be at a given position at a given time
  shortening the observation time towards the Planck time, makes an arrow disappear in the cloud that makes up spacetime

in the strand model, elementary particles are (families of) tangles of strands
in other words, elementary particles are not the basic building blocks of matter, strands are
if particles could really be elementary, it would be impossible to understand their properties
in the strand model, particles are not really elementary, but neither are they, in the usual sense, composed, particles are tangles of unobservable strands
in this way, the strand model retains the useful aspects of the idea of elementary particle, but gets rid of its limitations
if one wants to think radically, the strand model can be seen as, eliminating the concepts of elementariness and of particle

a model for spin 1/2 is part of physics folklore since almost a century, any belt provides an example, any localized structure with any number of tails attached to it (tails that reach the border of the region of space under consideration) has the same properties as a spin 1/2 particle, the only condition is that the tails themselves are unobservable
the tail model even has the same problems with highly curved space, as real spin 1/2 particles have
it is a famous exercise to show that such a model is indeed invariant under 4 'pi rotations, but not under 2 'pi rotations, and that two such particles get entangled when exchanged, but get untangled when exchanged twice, the tail model thus confirms that rotation is partial exchange
particles can have spin 1/2 provided that they have tails going to the border of space, if the tails do not reach the border, the model does not work
spin 1/2 thus even seems to require extension
