at extremely small scales of spacetime, called Planck scales, the mom_energy of quantum particles can be so high that black holes appear;
therefore at Planck scales, nature is not observable; spacetime is indistinguishable from particles and fields; they must be described by the same (unobservable) thing;
the rest of this section is quoted from "motion mountain" by Christoph Schiller;

general relativity and quantum theory contradict each other; in practice however, this happens only at Planck scales;
whenever we combine general relativity and quantum theory, the universe teaches us that it is not a set of parts; for this reason, any sentence or expression containing the term "universe", is probably meaningless, whenever complete precision is required;
despite the contradictions between quantum theory and general relativity, the Planck limits (c, Ä§ and c^4/4*G) remain valid;
there is an intriguing relation between Planck scales and cosmological scales, they seem to pose the same challenges to their description; there is a tight relation between large and small scales in nature; there seems to be little difference (if any at all) between the universe and nothing;

elements and sets must be abandoned, this radical conclusion is deduced from only two statements;
1, the necessity of using quantum theory whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Compton wavelength;
2, and of using general relativity whenever the dimensions are of the order of the Schwarzschild radius;
together, they mean that no precise description of nature can contain elements and sets;
the difficulties in complying with this result, explain why the unification of the two theories has not so far been successful;
not only does unification require that we stop using space, time and mass for the description of nature, it also requires that all distinctions, of any kind, should be only approximate; but all physicists have been educated on the basis of exactly the opposite creed;

combining quantum theory and general relativity leads us to several important results on the description of nature:
, the constituents of vacuum and particles cannot be points;
, there is no conceivable way to prove that points exist, as the smallest measurable distance in nature is the Planck length;
, vacuum and particles mix at Planck scales, as there is no conceivable way to distinguish whether a Planck sized region is part of a particle or of empty space;
, matter, radiation and vacuum cannot be distinguished at Planck scales, they are made of common constituents;
, particles, vacuum and continuous space do not exist at Planck scales, they disappear in a yet unclear Planck scale mixture;

distinguishing between two entities requires different measurement results, for example, different positions, masses or sizes;
whatever quantity we choose, at Planck energy the distinction becomes impossible;

we need a description of nature that allows us to state that at Planck energy nothing can be distinguished from anything else;
there is only one solution, everything (or at least, what we call "everything" in everyday life) must be made of the same single constituent; every point in space, every event, every particle and every instant of time must be made of the same single constituent;
